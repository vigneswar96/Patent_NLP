The terminal can receives downlink control information (DCI), which comprises a field for indicating the resource allocation information of the ter minal. This resource assignment field within the DCI has a predetermined number of bits. The terminal can determines its assigned resource allocation information from the content of the received DCI, even though the bit size of the resource allocation field in the received DCI is insufficient to represent all allowed resource allocations. According to an embodi ment, the received bits that are signaled to the terminal in the DCI represent predetermined bits of the resource allocation information. All remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not included in the field of the received DCI are set to predetermined value. NE OFDM symbols Nol.

The invention generally relates to the signaling of resource allocation information to a terminal of a mobile communication system for assigning resources to the termi nal. In particular, the invention relates to the signaling of resource allocations using downlink control information for single-cluster and multi-cluster allocations in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. More specifically, one aspect of the invention provides a concept for signaling resource allocation informa tion for cases where the number of available bits within the downlink control information is insufficient to represent all possible resource allocations that are Supported by the sys tem, for example, all allowed combinations of single-cluster or multi-cluster allocations. In principle, the disclosed inven tion can be applied to the signaling of uplink resource allo cation information and downlink resource allocation infor mation, while additional advantages are achieved with regard to certain configuration of uplink resource allocations in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 0002. In mobile communication systems, a base station assigns downlink resources to a terminal, which the base station can use for downlink transmissions to said terminal, and/or assigns uplink resources to a terminal, which said terminal can use for uplink transmissions. The downlink and/ or uplink resource allocation (or assignment) is signaled from the base station (or another related network device) to the terminal. The downlink and/or uplink resource allocation information is typically signaled as part of a downlink control information having multiple predefined flags and/or pre defined fields, one of which being a field dedicated for sig naling the resource allocation information. 0003 Typically, the available number of bits that can be used to signal the resource assignment information to the terminals is predetermined by a technical specification. For example, technical specification defines the size and format of the downlink control information within which the resource assignment information is transmitted to the termi nals. 0004. Likewise, the resource allocations, or the size of the resource allocations are predetermined by a technical speci fication. Moreover, assignment of the uplink or downlink resources to the terminals is typically defined and given by a technical specification. For example, the uplink resources can be expressed as resource blocks, meaning that the granularity on which a user or terminal can be allocated uplink resources is the number and the position of the assignable uplink resource blocks. In this case, the technical specification typi cally defines the allowed combinations of resource blocks that are Supported by the mobile communication system. Since the allowed resource allocations, the size of the resource allocations or the Supported combinations of assign able resources are defined or predetermined, the number of bits that is required to denote all supported (combinations of) resource(s) is effectively given. 0005. Therefore, neither the available number of bits that\n",
      "Chunk 3: can be used to signal the resource assignment information nor Jan. 30, 2014 the required number bits to denote the supported (combina tions of) resource(s) can freely be chosen. 0006. The present invention has recognized that situations can occur, in which the number of bits that is available for signaling the resource assignment information is insufficient to represent all possible resource assignments that are Sup ported by the communication system. 0007. The general concepts of the invention are described below in regard to 3GPP LTE and LTE-A communication systems and particularly for multiple cluster allocations specified in 3GPP LTE(-A). However, it is to be understood that the reference to 3GPPLTE and LTE-A is only an example according to specific embodiments of the invention but the general concepts of the invention can be applied to different resource allocation processes of different communication systems. 0008. The disclosed embodiments of the invention for sig naling uplink resource information to a terminal can be applied to the signaling of downlink resource information without departing from the invention. For example, the down link resources according to LTE(-A) are assigned by the scheduler as resource blocks (RB) as the smallest possible unit of resources. The downlink component carrier (or cell) is Subdivided in the time-frequency domain in Sub-frames, which are each divided into two downlink slots for signaling control channel region (PDCCH region) and OFDM symbols. As such, the resource grid as illustrated in FIG. 3 for uplink resources in LTE(A) has the same structure for downlink resources. Therefore, the signaling of allocated downlink resources with fewer bits that would be required to express all allowed resource block allocations that are supported by the communication system can be achieved in the same manner as suggested herein with regard to downlink resources. 0009 Moreover, the terms “resource assignment” and “resource allocation' are used in this specification to denote both the same technical meaning of assigning or allocating resources. Both terms are therefore interchangeable without any change in content and technical meaning. Long Term Evolution (LTE) 0010. Third-generation mobile systems (3G) based on WCDMA radio-access technology are deployed on a broad scale all around the world. A first step in enhancing or evolv ing this technology entails introducing High-Speed Down link Packet Access (HSDPA) and an enhanced uplink, also referred to as High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), giving a radio-access technology that is highly competitive. 0011. In order to be prepared for further increasing user demands and to be competitive against new radio access technologies 3GPP introduced a mobile communication sys tem called Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is designed to meet the carrier needs for high speed data and media transport as well as high capacity Voice Support to the next decade. The ability to provide high bit rates is a key measure for LTE. 0012. The work item (WI) specification on Long-Term Evolution (LTE) called Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Net work (UTRAN) is finalized as Release 8 (LTE). The LTE system represents efficient packet-based radio access and radio access networks\n",
      "Chunk 4: that provide full IP-based functional ities with low latency and low cost. According to LTE, Scal able multiple transmission bandwidths are specified Such as 1.4, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 MHz, in order to achieve flexible system deployment using a given spectrum. In the US 2014/0029537 A1 downlink, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based radio access was adopted due to its inherent immunity to multipath interference (MPI) caused by a low symbol rate, the use of a cyclic prefix (CP), and its affinity to different transmission bandwidth arrangements. Single-Car rier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) based radio access was adopted in the uplink, since provisioning of wide area coverage was prioritized over improvement in the peak data rate considering the restricted transmission power of the user equipment (UE). Many key packet radio access techniques are employed including multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) channel transmission techniques, and a highly efficient control signaling structure is achieved in LTE (for example, Release 8). LTE Architecture 0013 The overall architecture of a communication system according to LTE(-A) shown in FIG. 1. A more detailed representation of the E-UTRAN architecture is given in FIG. 2. 0014) The E-UTRAN comprises an eNodeB that provides the E-UTRA user plane (PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY) and con trol plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the user equipment (UE). The eNodeB (eNB) hosts the Physical (PHY), Medium Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), and Packet Data Control Protocol (PDCP) layers that include the functionality of user-plane header-compression and encryption. It also offers Radio Resource Control (RRC) functionality corresponding to the control plane. It performs many functions including radio resource management, admission control, Scheduling, enforcement of negotiated uplink Quality of Service (QoS), cell information broadcast, ciphering/deciphering of user and control plane data, and compression/decompression of downlink/uplink user plane packet headers. The eNodeBs are interconnected with each other by means of the X2 interface. 0015 The eNodeBs are further connected by means of the S1 interlace to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core). More specifi cally, eNodeBs are connected to the MME (Mobility Man agement Entity) by means of the S1-MME and to the Serving Gateway (SGW) by means of the S1-U. The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relation between MMES/Serving Gateways and eNodeBs. The SGW routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (ter minating S4 interface and relaying the traffic between 2G/3G systems and PDN GW). For idle state user equipments, the SGW terminates the downlink data path and triggers paging when downlink data arrives for the user equipment. It man ages and stores user equipment contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service, network internal routing information. It also performs replication of the user traffic in case of lawful interception. 0016. The MME is the key control-node for the LTE access-network. It is responsible for idle mode user equip ment tracking and paging procedure including retransmis sions. It is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation pro cess and is also responsible for\n",
      "Chunk 5: choosing the SGW for a user equipment at the initial attach time and at the time of intra LTE handover involving Core Network (CN) node relocation. It is responsible for authenticating the user (by interacting with the HSS). The Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling terminates at the MME and it is also responsible for genera Jan. 30, 2014 tion and allocation of temporary identities to user equip ments. It checks the authorization of the user equipment to camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces user equipment roaming restrictions. The MME is the termination point in the network for cipher ing/integrity protection for NAS signaling and handles the security key management. Lawful interception of signaling is also supported by the MME. The MME also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 2G/3G access networks with the S3 interface terminating at the MME from the SGSN. The MME also terminates the S6a interface towards the home HSS for roaming user equip mentS. Component Carrier Structure in LTE (0017. The downlink component carrier of a 3GPP LTE (such as Release 8) is subdivided in the time-frequency domain in so-called sub-frames. In 3GPP LTE each sub frame is divided into two downlink slots as illustrated in FIG. 3, wherein the first downlink slot comprises the control chan nel region (PDCCH region) within the first OFDM symbols. Each sub-frame consists of a given number of OFDM sym bols in the time domain (12 or 14 OFDM symbols in 3GPP LTE Release 8), wherein each of OFDM symbol spans over the entire bandwidth of the component carrier. Thus, each OFDM symbol consists of a number of modulation symbols transmitted on respective N'xN subcarriers as also shown in FIG. 4. 10018 Assuming a multi-carrier communication system, e.g. employing OFDM, as for example used in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), the smallest unit of resources that can be assigned by the scheduler is one “resource block”. A physical resource block is defined as N.T. consecutive OFDM symbols in the time domain and N. consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain as illustrated in FIG. 4. In 3GPP LTE (such as Release 8), a downlink physical resource block thus consists of N, 'xN' resource elements, cor responding to one slot in the time domain and 180 kHz in the frequency domain. Further details on the downlink resource grid can be obtained, for example, from 3GPP TS 36.211, “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA): Physical Channels and Modulation (Release 8), version 8.9.0 or 9.0.0, section 6.2, available at http://www.3gpp.org and incorporated herein by reference. Likewise, the sub frame structure on a downlink component carrier and the downlink resource grid illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 are obtained from 3GPP TS 36.211. 0019 For the LTE uplink resource allocation, the structure of the resource blocks is comparable to the above structure of the downlink resource grid. For the uplink resources, each OFDM symbol consists of a number of modulation symbols transmitted on respective N'-xNs subcarriers as also shown in FIG. 5. The exemplary structure of an uplink\n",
      "Chunk 6: resource grid illustrated in FIG.5 corresponds to the structure of the exemplary downlink resource grid illustrated in FIG. 4. The exemplary uplink resource grid of FIG. 4 is obtained from 3GPP TS 36.211 V10.0.0, which is incorporated herein by reference and provides further details of the uplink resources in LTE (Release 10). L1/L2 Control Signaling Downlink Control Information in LTE(-A) 0020. In order to informa scheduled user or terminal about their allocation status, transport format and other data related US 2014/0029537 A1 information (e.g. HARQ information), L1/L2 (Layer1/ Layer2) control signaling is transmitted on the downlink along with the data. L1/L2 control signaling is multiplexed with the downlink data in a Sub-frame, assuming that the user allocation can change from Sub-frame to Sub-frame. It should be noted that user allocation might also be performed on a TTI (Transmission Time Interval) basis, where the TTI length is a multiple of the sub-frames. The TTI length may be fixed in a service area for all users, may be different for different users, or may even by dynamic for each user. Generally, the L1/2 control signaling needs only be transmitted once per TTI. The L1/L2 control signaling is transmitted on the Physical Down link Control Channel (PDCCH). It should be noted that in 3GPP LTE, assignments for uplink data transmissions, also referred to as uplink scheduling grants or uplink resource assignments, are also transmitted on the PDCCH. 0021 Generally, the information sent on the L1/L2 control signaling (particularly LTE(-A) Release 10) can be catego rized to the following items: 0022. User identity, indicating the user that is allocated. This is typically included in the checksum by masking the CRC with the user identity; 0023 Resource allocation information, indicating the resources (Resource Blocks, RBs) on which a user is allocated. Note, that the number of RBs on which a user is allocated can be dynamic; 0024 Carrier indicator, which is used if a control chan nel transmitted on a first carrier assigns resources that concern a second carrier, i.e. resources on a second carrier or resources related to a second carrier; 0025 Modulation and coding scheme that determines the employed modulation scheme and coding rate; 0026. HARQ information, such as a new data indicator (NDI) and/or a redundancy version (RV) that is particu larly useful in retransmissions of data packets or parts thereof; 0027 Power control commands to adjust the transmit power of the assigned uplink data or control information transmission; 0028 Reference signal information such as the applied cyclic shift and/or orthogonal cover code index, which are to be employed for transmission or reception of reference signals related to the assignment; 0029. Uplink or downlink assignment index that is used to identify an order of assignments, which is particularly useful in TDD systems; 0030 Hopping information, e.g. an indication whether and how to apply resource hopping in order to increase the frequency diversity; 0031 COI request, which is used to trigger the trans mission of channel state information in an assigned resource; and 0032 Multi-cluster information, which is a flag used to indicate and control\n",
      "Chunk 7: whether the transmission occurs in a single cluster (contiguous set of RBs) or in multiple clusters (at least two non-contiguous sets of contiguous RBs). Multi-cluster allocation has been introduced by 3GPP LTE-(A) Release 10. 0033. It is to be noted that the above listing is non-exhaus tive, and not all mentioned information items need to be present in each PDCCH transmission depending on the DCI format that is used. 0034. DCI occurs in several formats that differ in their overall size and the field information that is used. The differ Jan. 30, 2014 ent DCI formats that are currently defined for LTE(-A) Release 10 are described in detail in TS 36.212 v10.0.0 in section 5.3.3.1, available at http://www.3gpp.org and incor porated herein by reference. 0035. The following two specific DCI formats defined in LTE show exemplarily some of the functionality of the vari ous DCI formats: 0036) DCI format 0 is used for the scheduling of the PUSCH (Physical UplinkShared Channel) using single antenna port transmissions in uplink transmission mode 1 or 2, 0037 DCI format 4 is used for the scheduling of the PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel) using closed-loop spatial multiplexing transmissions in uplink transmission mode 2. 0038 Uplink transmission modes 1 and 2 are defined in TS 36.213 v10.0.1 in section 8.0, the single-antenna port is defined in section 8.0.1, and the closed-loop spatial multi plexing is defined in section 8.0.2, which are available at http://www.3gpp.org and incorporated herein by reference. 0039. There are several different ways how to exactly transmit the information pieces mentioned above. Moreover, the L1/L2 control information may also contain additional information or may omit some of the information, Such as: 0040 the HARQ process number may not be needed in case of a synchronous HARQ protocol, as, for example, used in uplink, 0041 Spatial-multiplexing related control information, such as, for example, precoding, may be additionally included in the control signaling, or 0042. In case of multi-codeword spatial multiplexing transmission, the MCS and/or HARQ information for multiple code words may be included. 0043. For uplink resource assignments (e.g. concerning the Physical Uplink Shared Channel, PUSCH) signaled on PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) in LTE, the L1/L2 control information does not contain a HARQ process number, since a synchronous HARO protocol is employed for LTE uplink transmissions. The HARQ process to be used for an uplink transmission is determined and given by the speci fied timing. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the redundancy version (RV) information and the MCS information are jointly encoded. Downlink & Uplink Data Transmissions in LTE(-A) 0044) This section provides further background on down link and uplink data transmissions according to the technical specification of LTE(A) that may be useful to comprehend the background, framework and full usability of the subse quently discussed embodiments of the invention. This section therefore provides only illustrative information concerning background information, a person skilled in the field of the invention will consider as common knowledge. 0045 Regarding downlink data transmission in LTE, L1/L2 control signaling is transmitted on a separate physical channel (PDCCH), along\n",
      "Chunk 8: with the downlink packet data transmission. This L1/L2 control signaling typically contains information on: 0046. The physical resource(s) on which the data is transmitted (e.g. Subcarriers or Subcarrier blocks in case of OFDM, codes in case of CDMA). This information allows the UE (receiver) to identify the resources on which the data is transmitted. US 2014/0029537 A1 0047. When user equipment is configured to have a Carrier Indication Field (CIF) in the L1/L2 control sig naling this information identifies the component carrier for which the specific control signaling information is intended. This enables assignments to be sent on one component carrier which are intended for another com ponent carrier (“cross-carrier scheduling'). This other, cross-Scheduled component carrier could be for example a PDCCH-less component carrier, i.e. the cross-Scheduled component carrier does not carry any L1/L2 control signaling. 0048. The Transport Format, which is used for the trans mission. This can be the transport block size of the data (payload size, information bits size), the MCS (Modu lation and Coding Scheme) level, the Spectral Effi ciency, the code rate, etc. This information (usually together with the resource allocation (e.g. the number of resource blocks assigned to the user equipment)) allows the user equipment (receiver) to identify the information bit size, the modulation scheme and the code rate in order to start the demodulation, the de-rate-matching and the decoding process. The modulation scheme may be signaled explicitly. 0049) Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) information: 0050 HARQ process number: Allows the user equip ment to identify the hybrid ARQ process on which the data is mapped. 0051 Sequence number or new data indicator (NDI): Allows the user equipment to identify if the transmis sion is a new packet or a retransmitted packet. If soft combining is implemented in the HARQ protocol, the sequence number or new data indicator together with the HARQ process number enables soft-combining of the transmissions for a PDU prior to decoding. 0.052 Redundancy and/or constellation version: Tells the user equipment, which hybrid ARQ redun dancy version is used (required for de-rate-matching) and/or which modulation constellation version is used (required for demodulation). 0053 UE Identity (UEID): Tells for which user equip ment the L1/L2 control signaling is intended for. In typical implementations this information is used to mask the CRC of the L1/L2 control signaling in order to pre vent other user equipments to read this information. 0054) To enable an uplink packet data transmission in LTE, L1/L2 control signaling is transmitted on the downlink (PDCCH) to tell the user equipment about the transmission details. This L1/L2 control signaling typically contains infor mation on: 0055. The physical resource(s) on which the user equip ment should transmit the data (e.g. Subcarriers or Sub carrier blocks in case of OFDM, codes in case of CDMA). 0056. When user equipment is configured to have a Carrier Indication Field (CIF) in the L1/L2 control sig naling this information identifies the component carrier for which the specific control signaling information is intended.

The Transport Format, the user equipment should use for the transmission. This can be the transport block size of the data (payload size, information bits size), the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) level, the Spec tral Efficiency, the code rate, etc. This information (usu ally together with the resource allocation (e.g. the num ber of resource blocks assigned to the user equipment)) allows the user equipment (transmitter) to pick the infor mation bit size, the modulation scheme and the code rate in order to start the modulation, the rate-matching and the encoding process. In some cases the modulation Scheme maybe signaled explicitly. 0059) Hybrid ARQ information: 0060 HARQ Process number: Tells the user equip ment from which hybrid ARQ process it should pick the data. 0061 Sequence number or new data indicator: Tells the user equipment to transmit a new packet or to retransmit a packet.

In typical implementations this information is used to mask the CRC of the L1/L2 con trol signaling in order to prevent other user equipments to read this information. 0064. There are several different available ways of how to exactly transmit the information pieces mentioned above in uplink and downlink data transmission in LTE. Moreover, in uplink and downlink, the L1/L2 control information may also contain additional information or may omit some of the infor mation. For example: 0065 HARQ process number may not be needed, i.e. is not signaled, in case of a synchronous HARQ protocol. 0.066.

The Transport Format (TF) respectively modulation and cod ing scheme (MCS) field has for example a size of 5 bits, which corresponds to 32 entries. 3 TF/MCS table entries are reserved for indicating redundancy versions (RVs) 1, 2 or 3. The remaining MCS table entries are used to signal the MCS level (TBS) implicitly indicating RV0. The size of the CRC field of the PDCCH is 16 bits. 0071. For downlink assignments (PDSCH) signaled on PDCCH in LTE the Redundancy Version (RV) is signaled separately in a two-bit field. Furthermore the modulation order information is jointly encoded with the transportformat information. Similar to the uplink case there is 5 bit MCS field signaled on PDCCH. 3 of the entries are reserved to signal an explicit modulation order, providing no Transport format (Transport block) info. For the remaining 29 entries modula tion order and Transport block size info are signaled. Resource Allocation Fields for Uplink Resource Assignments 0072 According to 3GPP TS 36.212 v10.0.0, the DCI formats 0 can, for example, be used for uplink resources assignments. The DCI formats 0 contains—amongst oth ers—a so-called “resource block assignment and hopping resource allocation” field, which has a size of log. (N.' (N'+1)/2) bits, where madenotes the number of resource blocks in the uplink. LTE-(A) presently foresees three pos sible uplink resource allocation schemes, which are single cluster allocation with non-hopping PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared channel), single-cluster allocation with hop ping PUSCH and multi-cluster allocation. Multi-cluster allo cation is introduced in Release 10 and is only supported as with non-hopping PUSCH. 0073. In case of a single-cluster allocation with non-hop ping PUSCH, the entire “resource block assignment and hop ping resource allocation” field of the DCI is used to signal the resource allocation in the uplink Sub-frame. 0074. In case of a single-cluster allocation with hopping PUSCH, the N, MSB (most significant bits) of the field are used to specify the detailed hopping configuration, while the remainder of the field provides the resource allocation in the first slot in the uplink sub-frame. Nz can thereby be determined from the system bandwidth according to table 1. Table 1 is obtained from table 8.4-1 of 3GPP TS 36.213 v10.0.1, which is incorporated herein by reference. The sys tem bandwidth N' denotes the number of uplink physical resource blocks. TABLE 1. System Number of Hopping bits Bandwidth for second slot RA N.' NUL hop 6-49 1 SO-110 0075. In case of a multi-cluster allocation with non-hop ping PUSCH, the uplink resource allocation is signaled using the concatenation of the frequency hopping flag field and the resource block assignment and hopping resource allocation field of the DCI. Jan. 30, 2014 0076. The case of multi-cluster allocation with hopping PUSCH is not defined in\n",
      "Chunk 11: LTE. For this reason, the frequency hopping flag field (as required for single-cluster allocation) can be used for signaling uplink resource allocation in case of multi-cluster allocation. 0077. For multi-cluster allocations, (\"I bits are required to denote or specify all allowed and Sup ported combinations. According to 3GPP LTE(-A) multi cluster allocation, the Smallest unit of uplink resources that can be assigned is one “resource block group' (RBG) as outlined below in more details. 0078. The size of the RBG can be determined from the system bandwidth according to table 2. Table 2 is obtained from table 7.1.6.1-1 of 3GPP TS 36.213 v10.0.1 by replacing NP with N' accordingly. The system bandwidth N' denotes the number of uplink physical resource blocks. TABLE 2 System Bandwidth RBG Size Noa' (P) s10 1 11-26 2 27-63 3 64-110 4 Multi-Cluster Allocation Interpretation 0079. As mentioned above, hopping is not supported for LTE multi-cluster RBA. The hopping flag of the DCI is there fore prepended to the RBA field, which increases the size by 1 bit. While for single-cluster the allocation is based on a resource-block granularity, for multi-cluster allocations the granularity is based on a resource block group (RBG). An RBG is the union of Padjacent RBs, where P can be estab lished using Table 2 for any uplink system bandwidth sup ported by LTE. The only exception is the case where N' is not an integer multiple of P. and where therefore the last RBG contains the remaining RBs. Each RB is part of only one RBG. The number of uplink RBGsNo' can then be com puted as 0080. As multi-cluster allocation is known and defined in 3GPP LTE Release 10, further details of the RBGs and the allowed combination of RBs (which form the RBGs) that are Supported by the system are not required and therefore omit ted. The multi-cluster allocation according to 3GPP LTE Release 10 and specifically the DCI format 0 for signaling the multi-cluster resource allocation as defined in 3GPP TS 36.212 V10.0.0 is incorporated herein by reference. I0081. According to 3GPP LTE Release 10, multi-cluster allocations are restricted to Support only two clusters, where US 2014/0029537 A1 the first cluster is identified by the starting RBG so and ending RBG S-1, and where the second cluster is identified by the starting RBGS and ending RBGS-1. These four parameters are then linked into a single value r which represents the multi-cluster allocation by the following formula: where M-4 (corresponding the four starting and ending RBGs that define a multi-cluster consisting of two clusters), N=N-1 and 1sso-s-s-s-sN, and where X ()-Christ X > y I0082. Furthermore, 3GPP LTE Release 10 requires that the two clusters are non-adjacent, i.e. there is a spacing of at least one RBG between the end of the first cluster and the start of the second cluster. This conditions leads to the above formula and the inequality relations between values so s,s, Ss. 0083. The present invention has recognized that for most cases (i.e. for most values of the uplink system bandwidth define by the specification\n",
      "Chunk 12: 3GPP TS 36.213), the number of available bits in the DCI and required bits to denote all allowed RBG allocation combinations supported by the sys tem are matching. However, for Some cases an insufficient number of bits is available in the DCI as outlined above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 0084. The invention is intended to overcome one or more of the discussed and outlined problems of known resource allocation concepts of mobile communication systems or to improve the signaling of the known resource allocation con cepts. 0085. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method for signaling resource allocation informa tion to a terminal of a mobile communication system used for assigning resources to the terminal, as well as a correspond ing terminal and a corresponding base station. I0086. This object is solved by the subject matter of the independent claims. 0087 Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined by the dependent claims. 0088. The present invention has recognized that situations can occur, in which the number of bits available for signaling the resource assignment information is insufficient to repre sent the allowed resource assignments that are Supported by the communication system. In case of LTE, the “allowed resource assignments’ can be the different RBG (i.e., the allowed combinations of RBs) resource allocations that are Supported by the system for multi-cluster allocation. 0089. A first embodiment of the invention concerns a method performed by a terminal of a mobile communication system to receive and determine resource allocation informa tion that indicates to the terminal assigned resources for the terminal. The terminal receives, according to this embodi ment, downlink control information (DCI), which comprises Jan. 30, 2014 a field for indicating a resource allocation for the terminal. This resource assignment field within the DCI has a prede termined number of bits. The terminal determines its assigned resource allocation information from the content of that field in the received DCI, even though—at least for one or more specific resource allocation cases—the predetermined bit size of the resource allocation field in the received DCI is insuf ficient to represent all allowed resource allocations that are Supported by the communication system. According to this embodiment, it is therefore suggested that the received bits that are signaled to the terminal in the mentioned field of the DCI represent predetermined (subset of) bits of the resource allocation information. All remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not included in the field of the received DCI are set to predetermined value, e.g., to either 1 or 0. 0090 The DCI used to signal the resource allocation infor mation can have a predetermined format, in which case the number of bits of the field that is used for signaling the resource allocation information in the DCI can be predefined for any allowed bandwidths supported by the system. This implies that the terminal is able to determine the expected bit size of the signaled resource allocation information (i.e., the size of the field within the received DCI containing the resource allocation information).\n",
      "Chunk 13: 0091 Another embodiment of the invention concerns a method of transmitting resource allocation information for assigning resources to a terminal of a mobile communication system. For this, a base station determines the resource allo cation information to be transmitted to the terminal. The base station can further determine the number of bits that are available for signaling the resource allocation information within the downlink control information (DCI). The number of available bits can thereby be the size of one or more field(s) for transmitting resource allocation information within the DCI. The number of bits that are available for signaling the resource allocation information (i.e., the bit size of the men tioned field within the DCI) is predetermined for a given bandwidth (and can therefore be determined by the base station, and by the terminal as soon as it is aware of the relevant bandwidth). 0092. If the number of available bits for signaling the resource allocation information is insufficient to represent the plurality of allowed resource allocations, the base station transmits a predetermined subset of bits of the resource allo cation information within the field of the DCI to said terminal. All remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not, or cannot be, transmitted to the terminal have a predetermined value or are set to a predeter mined value. 0093. According to a specific embodiment of the invention the mobile communication system is a 3GPP LTE system or 3GPP LTE-A system. In this case, the terminal is a user equipment (UE) or a relay node. Likewise, the base station is an evolved Node B(eNodeB) or a relay node. The DCI format in this case can be the DCI format 0 as defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. Alternatively, DCI format 4 as defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A may be used for some embodi ments of the invention. 0094. The aforementioned remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not signaled in said field of said DCI can be the most significant bit(s), MSBs, or the least significant bit(s), LSBs, of said resource alloca tion information. US 2014/0029537 A1 0095. Further, the position and/or the value of these remaining one or more bits within the resource allocation information can either be predefined (e.g. in the system according to a technical requirements specification), or pre determined by the base station and then signaled to the ter minal. 0096. Further embodiments of the inventions concern 3GPP LTE, where the resource allocation information repre sents the allocation of resource blocks, RBS, according to a single-cluster resource allocation in DCI format 0 or DCI format 4 defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. 0097 Alternatively or additionally, the resource allocation information can represent the allocation of resource block groups, RBGs, according to a multi-cluster resource alloca tion in DCI format 0 or DCI format 4 defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A, where an RBG comprises a predefined plural ity of adjacent RBs. 0098. It is further foreseen according to an embodiment of the invention\n",
      "Chunk 14: that the value and the positions of said remain ing one or more bits of the resource allocation information (that are not signaled in the field of the DCI) are predeter mined in order to limit the number or combinations of RBs that are assignable to said terminal. 0099. Alternatively, the value and the positions of the remaining one or more bits can be predetermined to limit the number or combinations of RBGs that are assignable to the terminal. 0100. According to this embodiment of the invention, the predetermined value and the predetermined positions of the remaining one or more bits can be chosen so as to exclude an allocation of one or more edge physical resource blocks, PRBs, for example useable by the communication system for physical uplink control channel, PUCCH, transmissions. It may further be advantageous to exclude an allocation of one or more edge physical resource blocks since this reduces the amount of generated out-of-band interference, i.e. power that is leaked outside of the allowed bandwidth. 0101. Further embodiments of the invention propose a re-interpretation or re-mapping scheme for the signaled resource allocation information that is applied by the base station and/or the terminal to change the RBs, RBGs or the combinations thereof that are assignable to said terminal. 0102 This re-interpretation scheme can include a mirror ing from low RB or RBG indices to high RB or RBG indices, respectively, and vice versa. Alternatively or additionally, the re-interpretation scheme can include a shift of the signaled resource allocation information by a predetermined offset, wherein the offset is defined as a number of RBs or RBGs. 0103) The re-interpretation scheme can be configured by a base station or can be signaled by said base station to said terminal. 0104. According to a further embodiment of the invention is a method of transmitting resource allocation information for assigning uplink resources to a terminal of a 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system provided. The method is performed by a base station or relay node. The base station is configured to transmit resource allocation information within a field of downlink control information, DCI, to the terminal. The resource allocation information can thereby represent different resource block groups, RBGs, according to a multi-cluster resource allocation in said 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system. The available bit size of the field of the DCI used for transmitting the resource allocation information is thereby sufficient to represent a Jan. 30, 2014 plurality of possible uplink resource allocations, because the RBG size is determined according to a novel manner. 0105. The RBG size according to this embodiment of the invention can be determined for a given number of uplink resource blocks according to: Noa' Preo.\" s6, 8 1 7, 9-26 2 27-54 3 55-84,91-100 4 85-90, 101-110 5 0106 Alternatively, the RBG size according to this embodiment of the invention can be determined for a given number of uplink resource blocks according to: Noa' Preo.\" s6 1 7-26 2 27-54 3 SS-84 4 85-110 5 I0107.

According to still a further embodiment of the invention is method of receiving resource allocation informa tion for assigning uplink resources to a terminal of a 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system provided. The method is performed by the terminal or relay node. The ter minal is configured to receive downlink control information, DCI that comprises a field for signaling the resource alloca tion information of said terminal. This field has a predeter mined number of bits and the resource allocation information represents resource block groups, RBGs, according to a multi-cluster resource allocation in Said 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system. The bit size of the field of the DCI used for signaling the resource allocation information is thereby sufficient to represent a plurality of possible uplink resource allocations, because the RBG size is determined according to a novel manner. The manner of determining the RBG size for a given number of uplink resource blocks is based on either of the two tables shown above. 0109 According to yet another embodiment of the inven tion is terminal provided for receiving resource allocation information for assigning resources to said terminal within a mobile communication system. The terminal comprises means for receiving downlink control information, DCI that comprises a field for indicating the resource allocation infor mation of the terminal. The field has a predetermined number of bits. The terminal further comprises means for determining the resource allocation information from the bits of the field in the received DCI. The predetermined number of bits of the field in the received DCI is thereby insufficient to represent the plurality of allowed resource allocations that are sup ported by the communication system, e.g. insufficient to rep resent the plurality of allowed multi-cluster resource alloca tions. Therefore, it is suggested that the bits of the field in the received DCI represent predetermined bits of the resource US 2014/0029537 A1 allocation information, while all remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not included in the field of the received DCI are set to predetermined value. 0110. According to a further embodiment of the invention is a base station provided for transmitting resource allocation information for assigning resources to a terminal of a mobile communication system. The base station comprises means for determining resource allocation information that is to be transmitted to the terminal. The base station further com prises means for determining the number of available bits for signalling the resource allocation information within down link control information, DCI. The number of available bits is thereby the size of the field for transmitting resource alloca tion information within said DCI. Moreover, the DCI has a predetermined format and for a given bandwidth the number of bits available for signalling the resource allocation infor mation within the DCI is specified. The base station further comprises means for transmitting a predetermined Subset of the bits of the resource allocation information within the field of\n",

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 0121. This section will describe various embodiments of the invention. For exemplary purposes only, most of the Jan. 30, 2014 embodiments are outlined in relation to an orthogonal single carrier uplink radio access scheme according to 3GPP LTE (such as Release 8 or 9) and LTE-A (such as Release 10) mobile communication systems discussed in the Technical Background section above. It is to be noted that the invention may be advantageously used in connection with a mobile communication system such as 3GPP LTE and LTE-A com munication systems previously described, but the invention is not limited to this particular exemplary communication sys tem. I0122) The details given herein of 3GPP LTE and LTE-A are intended to provide a better understanding of the invention and should not be understood as limiting the invention to the described specific implementation details of the described mobile communication system. I0123. As discussed above, the invention has recognized that situations can occur, in which the number of bits available for signaling the resource assignment information is insuffi cient to represent the allowed resource assignments that are Supported by the communication system. In case of LTE multi-cluster allocation, the allowed resource\n",
      "Chunk 17: assignments are the different RBG (i.e., the allowed combinations of RBs) allocation combinations that are Supported by the system. 0.124 For the specific case of LTE multi-cluster alloca tions according to DCI format 0, the number of bits for the resource allocation field that are required to address all allowed RBG combinations is (as explained above) (\"I The bits available in the DCI to signal the uplink resource allocation to the terminal can be computed from log2(N.' (N'--1)/2)+1, where the \"+1\" is the result of using the “frequency hopping field flag as discussed in the back ground section and as specified in 3GPP LTE-A Release 10. (0.125 For most numeric cases covered by the 3GPP LTE specification for multi-cluster allocation, the number of avail able bits and required bits shows no problem. However, in some cases not sufficient bits are available, as shown in FIG. 6 0.126 Specifically, FIG. 6 shows the number bits available within DCI format 0 for specifying the allocated RBG and the number of required bits to specify all allowed RBG combi nations as supported and defined by 3GPP LTE, Release 10, for multi-cluster allocation. I0127. As can be obtained from FIG. 6 or the above given formulas, the number of bits available in the DCI format 0 is insufficient for the following number of N': 7, 9, 10, 55-63, 85-90, 101-110 (where only the range from 6-110has been regarded exemplarily and for simplicity). As noted above, N' denotes the system bandwidth in terms of the number of physical uplink resource blocks. I0128. For the 3GPP LTE-(A) specification, the currently Supported system bandwidth for uplink transmissions ranges from 6 to 110, while at least the values 5, 15, 25, 50, 75 and 100 are currently commonly used values. Thus, for com monly used system bandwidths the number of available bits in the DCI is sufficient to represent all allowed resource allocations. 0129. These “allowed’ resource allocations are the allo cations that are Supported by the technical specifications of US 2014/0029537 A1 LTE(-A). For single-cluster allocation, the allowed resource allocations are the different sets of uplink resource blocks that are assignable to the UEs and supported by the LTE(-A) system. More specifically, for single-cluster allocation, the assigned uplink resources are each adjacent uplink resource blocks (RBs). The assigned uplink resources are specified in the DCI by the first RB and the length of the uplink resource, i.e. the number RBs. The first RB and length information are combined into a resource indication value RIV, as provided by TS36.213 v10.0.1 section 8.1.1, that is to be signaled in the DCI. Additionally, the DCI includes a flag for indicating whether frequency hopping is used for the allocation. 0130. For multi-cluster allocation, the allowed resource allocations are the different combinations of uplink resource block groups (RBGs) that are assignable to the UEs and supported by the LTE(-A) system. More specifically, LTE multi-cluster allocation Supports multi-cluster allocation with two clusters, where each cluster is a chunk of adjacent RBGs (and therefore RBs) and where the two clusters are separated by at least one\n",
      "Chunk 18: RBG (as noted above and specified in LTE-A release 10). Thus, the plurality of different allowed resource allocations for multi-cluster allocation can be seen as all different combinations of RBGs within two clusters that are supported by the LTE-A specification. As noted before, the assigned multi-cluster allocation according to LTE Release 10 is signaled as one value r that is determined based on the beginning and ending RB of the two clusters according a rule defined in the LTE-A specification (e.g., TS 36.213 v10.0.1 section 8.1.2). As also noted above, the LTE-A speci fication further defines that the hopping flag of the DCI used for single-cluster allocation is to be also used when signaling the multi-cluster allocation information r. 0131 For future releases, the allowed number of clusters may be greater than two and multi-cluster allocation may be introduced for downlink resource allocation too. However, the allowed resource allocations, i.e. the different RBs or RBGs, and a manner to signal them to the UEs in DCI will also be provided by future releases. The number of bits that are required to represent all allowed resource allocations is given by and can unambiguously determined from the tech nical specification itself. 0.132. According to the example of FIG. 6., one or two additional resource information bits would be required (i.e. for bandwidths 7, 9, 10, 55-63, 85-90, 101-110) to be able to address all allowed RBGs that are supported by LTE, i.e. to represent all allowed values of the multi-cluster allocation information r. 0133. Since the number of bits is predefined by the LTE technical specification (as outlined above), the UE can deter mine the size of the signaled resource allocation information by itself, or the UE can be pre-configured to a given resource allocation information size. In other words, the LTE technical specification requires that for a given bandwidth (e.g., N'-7 in the example of FIG. 6) the resource allocation information (e.g., the value r) has a certain bit-size (e.g., 7 in the example of FIG. 6 for N'-7). Likewise, the LTE specification defines the DCI format including the size of field for signaling the resource allocation information to the UE. If this size is insufficient to representall allowed values r, the UE expects to receive resource allocation information with a certain bit size, but the actually received information in the DCI has a smaller bit-size. The UE behavior for handling Such a situation is not specified and therefore is undefined. The UE preferably ignores the whole received information in Jan. 30, 2014 this undefined situation to avoid behavior that negatively affects the terminal or system performance. I0134) To resolve the problem of insufficient bits in the DCI to representall allowed assignable resource allocations (e.g., for bandwidths 7, 9, 10, 55-63, 85-90, 101-110 in FIG. 6), the straightforward solution is to add the additionally required one or more bits to the respective field in the DCI so that all assignable resource allocations can be expressed and signaled to the UE. 0.135 However, this feasible solution has the drawback that it would not be\n",
      "Chunk 19: backward compatible to earlier LTE releases (e.g., releases 8 and 9), specifically to UEs that are manufactured to conform to those releases only. Moreover, it has the disadvantage that the resource allocation information signaled to the UE as part of the DCI has different sizes (i.e., different numbers of bits) for single-allocation and for mul tiple cluster allocation, which adds Substantial complexity because an additional DCI size that needs to be detected increases the blind decoding efforts required to detect the DCI at the UE. 0.136 The invention proposes a different solution to this problem caused by insufficient available bits in the DCI, including but not limited to LTE multi-cluster allocations according to DCI format 0. The proposed solution does not increase the number of bits used in the transmitted DCI for signaling the allocated resources, for example assigned RBGs for LTE multi-cluster allocations according to DCI format 0. and thereforekeeps the DCI detection complexity at the UE at the same level. 0.137 According to one embodiment of the invention, only as many bits of the resource allocation information as can be sent in the DCI are signaled to the UE if the number of available bits in the DCI is insufficient. All remaining bits of the resource allocation information (i.e. those bits for which additional bits would be required as discussed above) are assumed to be, or set to, a predefined value. In other words, these remaining bits of the resource allocation information (for example representing the value r discussed above for multi-cluster allocation) that cannot be signaled in the DCI due to insufficient bits are set to either 0 or 1. The “resource allocation information' in this context is the information required to represent all allocations (e.g., all RBGs for multi cluster allocation) that are supported by the LTE specifica tion. 0.138 Consequently, it is suggested to provide a new inter pretation of the signaled bits at the transmitter (eNodeB) and receiver (UE) sides so that the known and unchanged DCI format can nonetheless be used to signal a meaningful resource allocation information. (0.139. In the following, this approach for 3GPP LTE multi cluster allocation using DCI format 0 is developed. For this, the following mathematical properties are used: (Equation 1) 0140. It can be noted that each of these terms is 0 or a positive integer number for any non-negative integers Xandy. As the invention is concerned with uplink or downlink resource allocations, these conditions are always fulfilled. US 2014/0029537 A1 0141. To analyze the value r, it is helpful to analyze the relationship between the two first terms (\" \") and (, ) Assuming that N-SoeM and N-SeM-1, it is possible to write these terms as N - So N - S1 (\" \") and (, ) M - 1 respectively. 0142. The first term can be converted according to Equa tion 1 to: N - So N - (So + 1) N - (So + 1) ( -( )+( M - 1 }. Therefore, the following applies: (\".\") (. ) st M - 1 0144) Equality holds\n",

Consequently, it holds that 0146 The same can be applied mutatis mutandis for the other terms, so that the following relations are obtained: (\"\")-(E)-(E)-(,,) 0.147. It becomes therefore evident that applies, unless one of those terms equals Zero. Specifically, the case that the first term is not the largest value can only occur if 0.148. With x<y and M=4, it can be concluded that: 0149 SosN-3 With 1ss-s-s-s-sN, it further holds that: SisN-2 S2s N-1 US 2014/0029537 A1 When combining these two constraints, the inequality holds only in the following condition: 0150. To determine the largest value of r, it is sufficient to consider those cases where each term is non-zero. Then, in this specific case, r can be expressed as: -(-)-(, )-(-)-() 0151. Each term becomes largest if the N-s, term is as large as possible, i.e. in the following case: 0153. Moreover, for the maximum value ofr that can result for the Supported resource allocations, applies. 0154) when Furthermore, the largest values of r are obtained | N-so A M is largest, i.e. for so-1. Jan. 30, 2014 (O155 In LTE(-A), the edge PRBs (physical resource blocks) are likely used, configured, reserved or occupied for PUCCH (physical uplink control channel) transmissions. Therefore, the likelihood of assigning the edge PRBs (at both sides of the spectrum) is quite low. It follows that the prob ability that these edge PRBs (for example all RBGs that contain the edge PRBs) are allocated in a multi-cluster allo cation is comparably low. Furthermore, not using edge PRBs reduces the out-of-band emissions generated by transmis sions, so is advantageous even if those PRBs are not used configured, reserved or occupied for PUCCH transmissions. 0156 The largest signaled values for multi-cluster alloca tions occur when the start of the first cluster is in RBG 1, i.e. in the first RBG of the uplink bandwidth. The smallest sig naled values for multi-cluster allocations cannot be so easily predicted. 0157 For example, if the uplink system bandwidth is 7 PRBs, the following values apply: NE = 7 P = 1 Nia = 7 N = 8 1 s So < S < S2 < S3 is 8 8 - So 8 - S1 8-S2 8-S3 -- -- -- () ()() () ()-1-6) ina. F 4 u 0158 Consequently, for the example that the uplink sys tembandwidth is 7 PRBs, seventy different values rexist (0 to 69). These different values of r are the allowed uplink resource allocations Supported by the system. To represent seventy allowed values, 7 bits are required. 0159 For these parameters of the exemplary system band width of 7 PRBs, the equation provides that only 6 bits are available for\n",
      "Chunk 21: the signaling of r, even though 7 bits would be required to cover all seventy allowed r values. The seventy allowed values and the corre sponding RBG multi-cluster allocations of this example are shown in Table 2. (0160. It can further be observed from Table 2 that the values 64-69 (shown in italics) have in common that the first RBGs of the first clusteris RBG number 1, i.e. the first RBG of the system bandwidth. These states therefore correspond to those valid states where the MSB (i.e. the bit representing decimal 64) of r is set to 1. On the other hand, it can be observed that the states that are represented by the LSB of r set to 0 (shown in bold) share no similar characteristic, for example they do not share any identical starting or ending RBG of either cluster.

According to another embodiment of the invention, it is further proposed that: 0.165. The eNodeB, when determining the multi-cluster allocation, avoids assigning multi-cluster allocations that cannot be transmitted in the DCI. In other words, only those allocations are determined for which the MSB(s), where applicable, are 0. In this case, there is no need to inform the UE of the value of the MSB(s), as it assumes them to be Zero according to this invention. Alternatively, the UE can be informed of the value of the MSB(s), for example as part of control information sig naled to the UE. 0166 The following advantages are obtained for these embodiments: 0.167 Multi-cluster allocations can be supported for all values of the system bandwidth Na', even if insuffi cient bits are available to signal the unrestricted range of values of r (0168 Only allocations where the first RBG of the allo cation is on the first RBG of the uplink system band width cannot be realized. However, it is expected that the first RBG is typically not assigned due to the aspects mentioned above, so that the relative loss to the system is comparably negligible. (0169. Some allocations where the first RBG of the allo cation is on the first RBG of the uplink system band width can still be realized (for example by signaling values of r between 35 and 63): (0170. In contrast, if for example the MSB was set to 1, only allocations 64-69 could be signaled, which is a comparatively strong restriction to the usability of multi-cluster resource allocation. 0171 In\n",
      "Chunk 22: contrast, if for example the LSB was set to either 0 or 1, only 35 out of the above 70 cases of Table 2 could be signaled, which is also putting strong restrictions on the usability of multi-cluster resource allocation. Moreover, these allocations do not follow a particular pattern. 0172. In contrast, if only a a-priori defined restricted part of the bandwidth can be addressed by multi cluster allocations, it follows that for example the first RBG can never be assigned for multi-cluster alloca tions. In the example of Table 2, this would affect configurations 35-69 that would not be usable, i.e. 50% of the cases. 0173 According to another embodiment of the invention the same approach as outlined above is applied, i.e. to set the non-signaled MSB bits to Zero. However, in addition the interpretation of the signaled values is modified. For example, the last RBG can be blocked from being assignable instead of the first RBG as in the above example. This approach is a mirroring of the signaled allocations and can be achieved by are-mapping of the signaled information, Such as the signaled values so to s denoting the two clusters of RBGs for LTE multi-cluster allocation. The re-mapping can be achieved according to a further embodiment of the invention by the following equations: sapplied-N-1-signalled sapplied-N-1-signalled US 2014/0029537 A1 applied signailed S2 N+1-s sapplied-N+1-signalled 0.174. According to still another embodiment, the mirror ing can be also obtained by defining a re-interpretation of the r values. For the above example of Table 3, Table 4 shows possible relations, which are obtained from the above rules for re-interpreting the values so to S and the rule for obtaining an r-value from the values so to S. discussed above.

This embodiment is particularly advantageous if for example the last RBG consists of fewer PRBs than the first RBG. For example, assuming that N'-85, then the exem plary reinterpretation illustrated in Table 4 definition and a RBG size of P-4 (i.e., the RBG has 4 PRBs) one can deter mine that N'-22. Preferably, N'-1=21 RBGs are each set to a size of P-4 and the remaining 22\" RBG is composed of\n",
      "Chunk 23: only of 1 PRB. Generally, it is possible that either all RBGs will be of the same size P (if N' is an integer multiple of P), or N'-1 will be of size Pandone \"irregular RBG will be of size in the range {1,2,..., P-1}. This occurs usually if N' is not an integer multiple of P. 0176 It can be noted that the loss for the system is mini mum if the “irregular RBG cannot be assigned by multiple cluster allocations. However, this loss applies to multi-cluster allocation only and the PRBs of the “irregular RBG can still be assigned by single-cluster allocations, or by multi-cluster allocations that do not employ this re-interpretation, e.g. by other UES. (0177 Preferably, the “irregular RBG is either the first or the last RBG. If it is the first RBG, the approach without re-interpretation is beneficial, while in the other case, the approach including the re-interpretation of the signaled value can be advantageously applied. 0.178 According to still another embodiment, the re-inter pretation step can be applied by adding an offset to the sig naled r-value, i.e. applying r'PP=r8'+re. For example, re-r-r'8' with ris' as the maximum value that can be signaled with the available bits. Alternatively, ris' can be configured by the eNodeB and/or signaled to the UE. The advantage of is the simplicity of an implementation. 0179. As a simple (from implementation perspective) but not as effective alternative approach, the re-interpretation can consist of Subtracting the signaled value from the maximum value re'r-r's', i.e. in the above example to use rapplied 69-signated 0180 According to another embodiment of the invention, the re-interpretation to be applied could also be configured or signaled from the eNodeB. With such signaling, the flexibility of the possible assignments by eNodeB is increased, at the cost of more complex implementation at the UE side and possibly also at the transmitter side. In another aspect of this embodiment the re-interpretation behavior is configured by the base station for each UE individually and is signaled to same e.g. using higher layer signaling Such as RRC or MAC signaling in the context of LTE or LTE-A. For example, a first UE is configured without re-interpretation, while a second UE is configured with re-interpretation. Then, the first RBG can be allocated to the second UE and the last RBG can be allocated to the first UE in the same subframe using multi US 2014/0029537 A1 cluster allocations each, so that all RBGs in the system can actually be utilized simultaneously from a system perspec tive. 0181. In regard to the embodiments of the invention con cerning the proposed re-interpretation aspects, DCI format 0 or DCI format 4 of 3GPP LTE(-A), for example Release 10, may be used. Both DCI formats concern multi-cluster allo cation as discussed above. 0182 FIG. 7 shows an exemplary method for receiving and determining resource allocation information at a terminal of a mobile communication system as it can be used in regard to the discussed embodiments of the present invention. 0183. The exemplary method of FIG. 7 can be\n",
      "Chunk 24: performed by a terminal, such as a UE or a relay node in an LTE or UMTS system. The terminal receives control information that indicates allocated resources, such as allocated RBS or RBGs for uplink or downlink transmissions of the terminal. The allocated resources can be received as part of a DCI, as illustrated by step 701. 0184 The terminal will then extract the bits of the signaled resource allocation information from the received control information, as shown by step 703. In case of LTE, the DCI includes dedicated fields and/or flags for indicating at least the allocated resources (i.e., RBs or RBGs), as discussed above. Typically, the received resource allocation informa tion represents one or more bit-values that indicate the allo cated resources to the terminal as discussed above. 0185. The terminal determines in step 705 the allocated resource information from the received and extracted bits. As discussed above, steps 703 and 705 can be one and the same step, if the signaled information (e.g., the signaled bits in the resource allocation field of the DCI) specifies directly the allocated resource, as in prior systems discussed in the back ground section. According to embodiments of the invention, there could be insufficient bits available for signaling all allowed combinations of the allocated resources, in which case, the signaled bits received by the terminal do not directly indicate the allocated resource as discussed above. For some embodiments of the invention, non-signaled bits are set to a predefined value. In this case, the terminal can set these non-signaled bits according to the predefined scheme (that can be fixed at the terminal or signaled to the UE) as part of step 705 to result at the actual resource allocation informa tion. Alternatively, the terminal is configured to interpret the received bits according to the predefined scheme to identify actual allocated resource without actively setting the non signaled bits to a given value. In different embodiments of the invention, the signaled number of bits is sufficient to repre sent the allowed resource allocation and the steps 703 and 705 can be one step. 0186. As an optional step 707, the terminal can apply a re-interpretation or re-mapping of the signaled and received resource allocations can be applied according to the discussed re-interpretation embodiments of the invention. As also dis cussed, the re-interpretation can be also signaled to the ter minal, in which case an additional step of receiving and extracting an re-interpretation flag can be performed, either separately to or as part of steps 703 and 705. 0187 FIG. 7A shows exemplary steps that can be per formed as part of the determining step 705 of FIG. 7 accord ing to another embodiment of the present invention. As noted above, the terminal can determine the format and size of the received DCI, including the number (and location) of the bits used for signaling resource allocations. The number of Sig Jan. 30, 2014 naled bits is also referred to as the “number of available bits' in the above description of the different aspects of the present invention.\n",
      "Chunk 25: As it is also discussed above, the terminal is further able to determine the number of bits that is required to address or signal all allowed resource allocations that are Supported by the communication system. As such, the terminal can determine whether the signaled bits (i.e., the number of bits in the received DCI that are extracted in step 703 of FIG. 7) is sufficient to representall allowed resource allocations that are Supported by the communication system, as illustrated in step 710 of FIG 7A. 0188 If the number of signaled bits is sufficient, the extracted bits of step 703 of FIG. 7 are determined to be the resource allocation information, as shown in step 712 of FIG. 7A. 0189 If the number of signaled bits is insufficient, the extracted bits of step 703 of FIG. 7 are only one part of the resource allocation information. In this case, as shown by step 714, the predetermined one or more bits that are not signaled to the terminal (also referred to as the “remaining bit(s) in the above description of the different aspects of the present inven tion) are then added to the signaled bits as extracted bits in step 703 of FIG. 7. As discussed above, the position and the value of the non-signaled bits that are to be added are prede termined. The result of combining the extracted bits and the predetermined non-signaled bits as illustrated in step 714 is then used as the resource allocation information. Thereafter, the re-interpretation step 707 of FIG. 7 can be performed using the result of either step 712 or step 714. 0.190 FIG. 8 shows an exemplary method for determining and transmitting resource allocation information by a base station of a mobile communication system as it can be used in regard to the discussed embodiments of the present invention. (0191). The exemplary method of FIG. 8 can be performed a base station, such as an eNodeB/NodeB or a relay node in an LTE or UMTS system. The base station determines the assigned resources allocation for a terminal. Such as allocated RBs or RBGs for uplink or downlink transmissions of the terminal, as illustrated by step 801. 0.192 According to step 803, the base station determines whether the number of available bits is sufficient for repre senting the allowed resource allocations Supported by the system as discussed above for several embodiments of the invention. 0193 If the number of available bits is sufficient, the base station can create the DCI in the common manner as illus trated by step 807. 0194 If the number of available bits is insufficient, the base station can set one or more predetermined bits of the resource allocation information (i.e. the resource allocation information that would have to be signaled to address all allowed resource allocations Supported by the system) to a predetermined value, as illustrated by step 809 and discussed above for several embodiments of the invention. 0.195 According to step 811, the base station creates the DCI with those bits to be signaled according to the respective embodiments\n",
      "Chunk 26: of the invention. (0196) Steps 803,805 and 809 can be performed once by the base station or only under given circumstances, but not for each control information signaling step. The result can then be applied in multiple Subsequent signaling steps and for creating and transmitting several DCIS to terminal(s) serviced by the base station. Alternatively, the numbers of bits and values determined can be predefined or fixed, in which case US 2014/0029537 A1 steps 803,805 and 809 do not have to be performed by the base station. Moreover, some embodiments of the invention concern the case where there are sufficient bits available, such as the embodiments of the invention concerning the re-inter pretation aspect that can be implemented with and without sufficient bits as discussed above. For these embodiments of the steps 803,805 and 809 may not be performed by the base station. 0197) Once the DCI is created, the base station can trans mit the DCI to the terminal as illustrated in step 813. (0198 The exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 can concern the same communication system in that the DCI received by the terminal in step 701 was transmitted by the base station in step 813. (0199 Instead of setting the MSB(s) of the resource allo cation information (e.g., the allocated RBGs) to 0 as dis cussed above, the bit(s) that are set and/or the value to which they are set can be configured by the eNodeB. 0200 Whethera re-interpretation is applied or not can also be configured by the eNodeB, preferably per UE. According to another embodiment, the status whether re-interpretation is applied is signaled in the control information that carries the resource allocation. This could be achieved by a single bit (on/off). If this bit is taken from the LTE DCI resource allo cation field according to the above example of Table 3, one additional MSB is set to zero. This means that with the earlier outlined example, instead of 6 available bits, 1 bit is used as a re-interpretation flag (on/off), while the remaining 5 bits denote the LSBs of r. Accordingly, the resources that can be assigned to an UE are limited to the values 0-31 of the Table 3. If the re-interpretation bit is set to “off, this means that states 0-31 from the table can be allocated. If the re-interpre tation flag is “on”, this means that states 0-31 can be signaled and a re-interpretation scheme is applied. According to another embodiment of the invention, the re-interpretation bit set to a first value means that a first set of States can be allocated by the available bits, and the re-interpretation bit set to a second value means that a second set of states can be allocated by the available bits. The first and second set of states can be configured and signaled by the base station. 0201 As it has been discussed above, embodiments of the present invention allows to define (preferably per UE) which RBs or RBGs or combinations thereof can actually be addressed with the available number of bits\n",
      "Chunk 27: if the signaling is insufficient to assign all allowed RB or RBG combinations in the multi-cluster approach. 0202) However, according to yet another embodiment of the invention, the number of RBGs (e.g., for multi-cluster allocation) or the number of RBS (e.g., for single-cluster allocation) that can be addressed by an available number of bits can be determined and set by the system or the base station. For example, the number of addressable RBGs can be determined by: 3 15 Ngiessable = -- 4. -- w 1 + 24.2\"bits available - 1 0203 Thus, the signaled bits can be interpreted to define a multi-cluster allocation in the range from RBG 1 to RBG N“”. Then, another parameter can be configurable which defines whether a re-interpretation is applied similar to the solutions outlined previously. Those skilled in the art will Jan. 30, 2014 recognize that the given formula can also be applied to deter mine the number of addressable RBs by substituting N.\" ad dressable by Nr. ressapie. 0204. It is to be noted that this embodiment of the inven tion can be used to limit the assignable resource allocations for a UE, even if the available number of signaling bits would be sufficient to address all allowed resource allocations. 0205. In addition, a re-interpretation can be defined such that the RB or RBG indices within the N' RBs are first configured. In case RBs are defined, those RBs are formed to RBGs, where generally non-adjacent RBs may be located in one RBG. The multi-cluster allocation signal is then used to assign RBGs from within this restricted set of RBGs. There is a choice whether the RBG size P is determined from the value N' or N'. The first has the advantage that the RBG size is identical for all UEs under the eNodeB, which simplifies the scheduling algorithm due to only the single RBG size which has to be taken into account. On the other hand, with the second way the granularity of the addressable RBGs is improved, particularly if a very restricted subset of RBs is defined for possible multi-cluster allocations. For example, in a system with N'-50 PRBs, the normal RBG size is P-3. The network could desire or decide to use only 16 out of those 50 PRBs (which for example corresponds to a frequency reuse factor of roughly /3 that is quite common in cellular communication systems). This means for the above mentioned first way that 6 RBGs, each of size 3 PRBs, are selected formulti-cluster allocation. For the abovementioned second way, there would be 8 RBGs of size 2 available for multi-cluster allocation, since for a system of 16 PRBs the RBG size is 2. Thus, the granularity and scheduling flexibility is increased. It can be noted that with the second way, it is possible that again more bits are required than available. However, in Such a case, the present invention has proposed a Solution to signal the allocations. 0206. Since the number of bits required for multi-cluster allocations depends on N' as well as on the RBG\n",
      "Chunk 28: size P (which is itself a function of N'), it is also possible to modify the definition of the RBG size P so that the number of available bits is sufficient to hold the multi-cluster allocation for the resulting number of RBGs. 0207. From the available number of bits for the multi cluster allocation, the number of addressable RBGs can be determined by 3 5 Nissable = * W 4 + w 1 + 24.2\"bits,available - 1. Therefore, the RBG size is determined from the number of uplink resource blocks and the number of addressable RBGs is determined by: ii. i. adaressable PRBG NRB /NRBG l. 0208 According to still another of the invention, it is therefore suggested to determining the RBG size for a given number of uplink resource blocks of a 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system by Table 5 (derived using the above formula) instead of the suggested Table 2 of the 3GPP LTE specification discussed in the background section.

The invention generally relates to the signaling of resource allocation information to a terminal of a mobile communication system for assigning resources to the termi nal. In particular, the invention relates to the signaling of resource allocations using downlink control information for single-cluster and multi-cluster allocations in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. More specifically, one aspect of the invention provides a concept for signaling resource allocation informa tion for cases where the number of available bits within the downlink control information is insufficient to represent all possible resource allocations that are Supported by the sys tem, for example, all allowed combinations of single-cluster or multi-cluster allocations. In principle, the disclosed inven tion can be applied to the signaling of uplink resource allo cation information and downlink resource allocation infor mation, while additional advantages are achieved with regard to certain configuration of uplink resource allocations in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 0002. In mobile communication systems, a base station assigns downlink resources to a terminal, which the base station can use for downlink transmissions to said terminal, and/or assigns uplink resources to a terminal, which said terminal can use for uplink transmissions. The downlink and/ or uplink resource allocation (or assignment) is signaled from the base station (or another related network device) to the terminal. The downlink and/or uplink resource allocation information is typically signaled as part of a downlink control information having multiple predefined flags and/or pre defined fields, one of which being a field dedicated for sig naling the resource allocation information. 0003 Typically, the available number of bits that can be used to signal the resource assignment information to the terminals is predetermined by a technical specification. For example, technical specification defines the size and format of the downlink control information within which the resource assignment information is transmitted to the termi nals. 0004. Likewise, the resource allocations, or the size of the resource allocations are predetermined by a technical speci fication. Moreover, assignment of the uplink or downlink resources to the terminals is typically defined and given by a technical specification. For example, the uplink resources can be expressed as resource blocks, meaning that the granularity on which a user or terminal can be allocated uplink resources is the number and the position of the assignable uplink resource blocks. In this case, the technical specification typi cally defines the allowed combinations of resource blocks that are Supported by the mobile communication system. Since the allowed resource allocations, the size of the resource allocations or the Supported combinations of assign able resources are defined or predetermined, the number of bits that is required to denote all supported (combinations of) resource(s) is effectively given. 0005. Therefore, neither the available number of bits that\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 3: Length = 512\n",
      "can be used to signal the resource assignment information nor Jan. 30, 2014 the required number bits to denote the supported (combina tions of) resource(s) can freely be chosen. 0006. The present invention has recognized that situations can occur, in which the number of bits that is available for signaling the resource assignment information is insufficient to represent all possible resource assignments that are Sup ported by the communication system. 0007. The general concepts of the invention are described below in regard to 3GPP LTE and LTE-A communication systems and particularly for multiple cluster allocations specified in 3GPP LTE(-A). However, it is to be understood that the reference to 3GPPLTE and LTE-A is only an example according to specific embodiments of the invention but the general concepts of the invention can be applied to different resource allocation processes of different communication systems. 0008. The disclosed embodiments of the invention for sig naling uplink resource information to a terminal can be applied to the signaling of downlink resource information without departing from the invention. For example, the down link resources according to LTE(-A) are assigned by the scheduler as resource blocks (RB) as the smallest possible unit of resources. The downlink component carrier (or cell) is Subdivided in the time-frequency domain in Sub-frames, which are each divided into two downlink slots for signaling control channel region (PDCCH region) and OFDM symbols. As such, the resource grid as illustrated in FIG. 3 for uplink resources in LTE(A) has the same structure for downlink resources. Therefore, the signaling of allocated downlink resources with fewer bits that would be required to express all allowed resource block allocations that are supported by the communication system can be achieved in the same manner as suggested herein with regard to downlink resources. 0009 Moreover, the terms “resource assignment” and “resource allocation' are used in this specification to denote both the same technical meaning of assigning or allocating resources. Both terms are therefore interchangeable without any change in content and technical meaning. Long Term Evolution (LTE) 0010. Third-generation mobile systems (3G) based on WCDMA radio-access technology are deployed on a broad scale all around the world. A first step in enhancing or evolv ing this technology entails introducing High-Speed Down link Packet Access (HSDPA) and an enhanced uplink, also referred to as High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), giving a radio-access technology that is highly competitive. 0011. In order to be prepared for further increasing user demands and to be competitive against new radio access technologies 3GPP introduced a mobile communication sys tem called Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is designed to meet the carrier needs for high speed data and media transport as well as high capacity Voice Support to the next decade. The ability to provide high bit rates is a key measure for LTE. 0012. The work item (WI) specification on Long-Term Evolution (LTE) called Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Net work (UTRAN) is finalized as Release 8 (LTE). The LTE system represents efficient packet-based radio access and radio access networks\n",

      "that provide full IP-based functional ities with low latency and low cost. According to LTE, Scal able multiple transmission bandwidths are specified Such as 1.4, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 MHz, in order to achieve flexible system deployment using a given spectrum. In the US 2014/0029537 A1 downlink, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based radio access was adopted due to its inherent immunity to multipath interference (MPI) caused by a low symbol rate, the use of a cyclic prefix (CP), and its affinity to different transmission bandwidth arrangements. Single-Car rier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) based radio access was adopted in the uplink, since provisioning of wide area coverage was prioritized over improvement in the peak data rate considering the restricted transmission power of the user equipment (UE). Many key packet radio access techniques are employed including multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) channel transmission techniques, and a highly efficient control signaling structure is achieved in LTE (for example, Release 8). LTE Architecture 0013 The overall architecture of a communication system according to LTE(-A) shown in FIG. 1. A more detailed representation of the E-UTRAN architecture is given in FIG. 2. 0014) The E-UTRAN comprises an eNodeB that provides the E-UTRA user plane (PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY) and con trol plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the user equipment (UE). The eNodeB (eNB) hosts the Physical (PHY), Medium Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), and Packet Data Control Protocol (PDCP) layers that include the functionality of user-plane header-compression and encryption. It also offers Radio Resource Control (RRC) functionality corresponding to the control plane. It performs many functions including radio resource management, admission control, Scheduling, enforcement of negotiated uplink Quality of Service (QoS), cell information broadcast, ciphering/deciphering of user and control plane data, and compression/decompression of downlink/uplink user plane packet headers. The eNodeBs are interconnected with each other by means of the X2 interface. 0015 The eNodeBs are further connected by means of the S1 interlace to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core). More specifi cally, eNodeBs are connected to the MME (Mobility Man agement Entity) by means of the S1-MME and to the Serving Gateway (SGW) by means of the S1-U. The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relation between MMES/Serving Gateways and eNodeBs. The SGW routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (ter minating S4 interface and relaying the traffic between 2G/3G systems and PDN GW). For idle state user equipments, the SGW terminates the downlink data path and triggers paging when downlink data arrives for the user equipment. It man ages and stores user equipment contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service, network internal routing information. It also performs replication of the user traffic in case of lawful interception. 0016. The MME is the key control-node for the LTE access-network. It is responsible for idle mode user equip ment tracking and paging procedure including retransmis sions. It is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation pro cess and is also responsible for\n",

      "choosing the SGW for a user equipment at the initial attach time and at the time of intra LTE handover involving Core Network (CN) node relocation. It is responsible for authenticating the user (by interacting with the HSS). The Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling terminates at the MME and it is also responsible for genera Jan. 30, 2014 tion and allocation of temporary identities to user equip ments. It checks the authorization of the user equipment to camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces user equipment roaming restrictions. The MME is the termination point in the network for cipher ing/integrity protection for NAS signaling and handles the security key management. Lawful interception of signaling is also supported by the MME. The MME also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 2G/3G access networks with the S3 interface terminating at the MME from the SGSN. The MME also terminates the S6a interface towards the home HSS for roaming user equip mentS. Component Carrier Structure in LTE (0017. The downlink component carrier of a 3GPP LTE (such as Release 8) is subdivided in the time-frequency domain in so-called sub-frames. In 3GPP LTE each sub frame is divided into two downlink slots as illustrated in FIG. 3, wherein the first downlink slot comprises the control chan nel region (PDCCH region) within the first OFDM symbols. Each sub-frame consists of a given number of OFDM sym bols in the time domain (12 or 14 OFDM symbols in 3GPP LTE Release 8), wherein each of OFDM symbol spans over the entire bandwidth of the component carrier. Thus, each OFDM symbol consists of a number of modulation symbols transmitted on respective N'xN subcarriers as also shown in FIG. 4. 10018 Assuming a multi-carrier communication system, e.g. employing OFDM, as for example used in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), the smallest unit of resources that can be assigned by the scheduler is one “resource block”. A physical resource block is defined as N.T. consecutive OFDM symbols in the time domain and N. consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain as illustrated in FIG. 4. In 3GPP LTE (such as Release 8), a downlink physical resource block thus consists of N, 'xN' resource elements, cor responding to one slot in the time domain and 180 kHz in the frequency domain. Further details on the downlink resource grid can be obtained, for example, from 3GPP TS 36.211, “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA): Physical Channels and Modulation (Release 8), version 8.9.0 or 9.0.0, section 6.2, available at http://www.3gpp.org and incorporated herein by reference. Likewise, the sub frame structure on a downlink component carrier and the downlink resource grid illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 are obtained from 3GPP TS 36.211. 0019 For the LTE uplink resource allocation, the structure of the resource blocks is comparable to the above structure of the downlink resource grid. For the uplink resources, each OFDM symbol consists of a number of modulation symbols transmitted on respective N'-xNs subcarriers as also shown in FIG. 5. The exemplary structure of an uplink\n",

The exemplary uplink resource grid of FIG. 4 is obtained from 3GPP TS 36.211 V10.0.0, which is incorporated herein by reference and provides further details of the uplink resources in LTE (Release 10). L1/L2 Control Signaling Downlink Control Information in LTE(-A) 0020. In order to informa scheduled user or terminal about their allocation status, transport format and other data related US 2014/0029537 A1 information (e.g. HARQ information), L1/L2 (Layer1/ Layer2) control signaling is transmitted on the downlink along with the data. L1/L2 control signaling is multiplexed with the downlink data in a Sub-frame, assuming that the user allocation can change from Sub-frame to Sub-frame. It should be noted that user allocation might also be performed on a TTI (Transmission Time Interval) basis, where the TTI length is a multiple of the sub-frames. The TTI length may be fixed in a service area for all users, may be different for different users, or may even by dynamic for each user. Generally, the L1/2 control signaling needs only be transmitted once per TTI. The L1/L2 control signaling is transmitted on the Physical Down link Control Channel (PDCCH). It should be noted that in 3GPP LTE, assignments for uplink data transmissions, also referred to as uplink scheduling grants or uplink resource assignments, are also transmitted on the PDCCH. 0021 Generally, the information sent on the L1/L2 control signaling (particularly LTE(-A) Release 10) can be catego rized to the following items: 0022. User identity, indicating the user that is allocated. This is typically included in the checksum by masking the CRC with the user identity; 0023 Resource allocation information, indicating the resources (Resource Blocks, RBs) on which a user is allocated. Note, that the number of RBs on which a user is allocated can be dynamic; 0024 Carrier indicator, which is used if a control chan nel transmitted on a first carrier assigns resources that concern a second carrier, i.e. resources on a second carrier or resources related to a second carrier; 0025 Modulation and coding scheme that determines the employed modulation scheme and coding rate; 0026. HARQ information, such as a new data indicator (NDI) and/or a redundancy version (RV) that is particu larly useful in retransmissions of data packets or parts thereof; 0027 Power control commands to adjust the transmit power of the assigned uplink data or control information transmission; 0028 Reference signal information such as the applied cyclic shift and/or orthogonal cover code index, which are to be employed for transmission or reception of reference signals related to the assignment; 0029. Uplink or downlink assignment index that is used to identify an order of assignments, which is particularly useful in TDD systems; 0030 Hopping information, e.g. an indication whether and how to apply resource hopping in order to increase the frequency diversity; 0031 COI request, which is used to trigger the trans mission of channel state information in an assigned resource; and 0032 Multi-cluster information, which is a flag used to indicate and control\n",

      "Chunk 7: Length = 512\n",
      "whether the transmission occurs in a single cluster (contiguous set of RBs) or in multiple clusters (at least two non-contiguous sets of contiguous RBs). Multi-cluster allocation has been introduced by 3GPP LTE-(A) Release 10. 0033. It is to be noted that the above listing is non-exhaus tive, and not all mentioned information items need to be present in each PDCCH transmission depending on the DCI format that is used. 0034. DCI occurs in several formats that differ in their overall size and the field information that is used. The differ Jan. 30, 2014 ent DCI formats that are currently defined for LTE(-A) Release 10 are described in detail in TS 36.212 v10.0.0 in section 5.3.3.1, available at http://www.3gpp.org and incor porated herein by reference. 0035. The following two specific DCI formats defined in LTE show exemplarily some of the functionality of the vari ous DCI formats: 0036) DCI format 0 is used for the scheduling of the PUSCH (Physical UplinkShared Channel) using single antenna port transmissions in uplink transmission mode 1 or 2, 0037 DCI format 4 is used for the scheduling of the PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel) using closed-loop spatial multiplexing transmissions in uplink transmission mode 2. 0038 Uplink transmission modes 1 and 2 are defined in TS 36.213 v10.0.1 in section 8.0, the single-antenna port is defined in section 8.0.1, and the closed-loop spatial multi plexing is defined in section 8.0.2, which are available at http://www.3gpp.org and incorporated herein by reference. 0039. There are several different ways how to exactly transmit the information pieces mentioned above. Moreover, the L1/L2 control information may also contain additional information or may omit some of the information, Such as: 0040 the HARQ process number may not be needed in case of a synchronous HARQ protocol, as, for example, used in uplink, 0041 Spatial-multiplexing related control information, such as, for example, precoding, may be additionally included in the control signaling, or 0042. In case of multi-codeword spatial multiplexing transmission, the MCS and/or HARQ information for multiple code words may be included. 0043. For uplink resource assignments (e.g. concerning the Physical Uplink Shared Channel, PUSCH) signaled on PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel) in LTE, the L1/L2 control information does not contain a HARQ process number, since a synchronous HARO protocol is employed for LTE uplink transmissions. The HARQ process to be used for an uplink transmission is determined and given by the speci fied timing. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the redundancy version (RV) information and the MCS information are jointly encoded. Downlink & Uplink Data Transmissions in LTE(-A) 0044) This section provides further background on down link and uplink data transmissions according to the technical specification of LTE(A) that may be useful to comprehend the background, framework and full usability of the subse quently discussed embodiments of the invention. This section therefore provides only illustrative information concerning background information, a person skilled in the field of the invention will consider as common knowledge. 0045 Regarding downlink data transmission in LTE, L1/L2 control signaling is transmitted on a separate physical channel (PDCCH), along\n",

      "with the downlink packet data transmission. This L1/L2 control signaling typically contains information on: 0046. The physical resource(s) on which the data is transmitted (e.g. Subcarriers or Subcarrier blocks in case of OFDM, codes in case of CDMA). This information allows the UE (receiver) to identify the resources on which the data is transmitted. US 2014/0029537 A1 0047. When user equipment is configured to have a Carrier Indication Field (CIF) in the L1/L2 control sig naling this information identifies the component carrier for which the specific control signaling information is intended. This enables assignments to be sent on one component carrier which are intended for another com ponent carrier (“cross-carrier scheduling'). This other, cross-Scheduled component carrier could be for example a PDCCH-less component carrier, i.e. the cross-Scheduled component carrier does not carry any L1/L2 control signaling. 0048. The Transport Format, which is used for the trans mission. This can be the transport block size of the data (payload size, information bits size), the MCS (Modu lation and Coding Scheme) level, the Spectral Effi ciency, the code rate, etc. This information (usually together with the resource allocation (e.g. the number of resource blocks assigned to the user equipment)) allows the user equipment (receiver) to identify the information bit size, the modulation scheme and the code rate in order to start the demodulation, the de-rate-matching and the decoding process. The modulation scheme may be signaled explicitly. 0049) Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) information: 0050 HARQ process number: Allows the user equip ment to identify the hybrid ARQ process on which the data is mapped. 0051 Sequence number or new data indicator (NDI): Allows the user equipment to identify if the transmis sion is a new packet or a retransmitted packet. If soft combining is implemented in the HARQ protocol, the sequence number or new data indicator together with the HARQ process number enables soft-combining of the transmissions for a PDU prior to decoding. 0.052 Redundancy and/or constellation version: Tells the user equipment, which hybrid ARQ redun dancy version is used (required for de-rate-matching) and/or which modulation constellation version is used (required for demodulation). 0053 UE Identity (UEID): Tells for which user equip ment the L1/L2 control signaling is intended for. In typical implementations this information is used to mask the CRC of the L1/L2 control signaling in order to pre vent other user equipments to read this information. 0054) To enable an uplink packet data transmission in LTE, L1/L2 control signaling is transmitted on the downlink (PDCCH) to tell the user equipment about the transmission details.

The physical resource(s) on which the user equip ment should transmit the data (e.g. Subcarriers or Sub carrier blocks in case of OFDM, codes in case of CDMA). 0056. When user equipment is configured to have a Carrier Indication Field (CIF) in the L1/L2 control sig naling this information identifies the component carrier for which the specific control signaling information is intended. This enables assignments to be sent on one component carrier which are intended for another com ponent carrier.\n",

The Transport Format, the user equipment should use for the transmission. This can be the transport block size of the data (payload size, information bits size), the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) level, the Spec tral Efficiency, the code rate, etc. This information (usu ally together with the resource allocation (e.g. the num ber of resource blocks assigned to the user equipment)) allows the user equipment (transmitter) to pick the infor mation bit size, the modulation scheme and the code rate in order to start the modulation, the rate-matching and the encoding process. In some cases the modulation Scheme maybe signaled explicitly. 0059) Hybrid ARQ information: 0060 HARQ Process number: Tells the user equip ment from which hybrid ARQ process it should pick the data. 0061 Sequence number or new data indicator: Tells the user equipment to transmit a new packet or to retransmit a packet. If soft combining is implemented in the HARQ protocol, the sequence number or new data indicator together with the HARQ process num ber enables soft-combining of the transmissions for a protocol data unit (PDU) prior to decoding. 0062 Redundancy and/or constellation version: Tells the user equipment, which hybrid ARQ redun dancy version to use (required for rate-matching) and/ or which modulation constellation version to use (re quired for modulation). 0063 UE Identity (UEID): Tells which user equipment should transmit data. In typical implementations this information is used to mask the CRC of the L1/L2 con trol signaling in order to prevent other user equipments to read this information. 0064. There are several different available ways of how to exactly transmit the information pieces mentioned above in uplink and downlink data transmission in LTE. Moreover, in uplink and downlink, the L1/L2 control information may also contain additional information or may omit some of the infor mation. For example: 0065 HARQ process number may not be needed, i.e. is not signaled, in case of a synchronous HARQ protocol. 0.066. A redundancy and/or constellation version may not be needed, and thus not signaled, if Chase Combin ing is used (always the same redundancy and/or constel lation version) or if the sequence of redundancy and/or constellation versions is pre-defined. 0067 Power control information may be additionally included in the control signaling. 0068. MIMO related control information, such as e.g. pre-coding, may be additionally included in the control signaling. 0069. In case of multi-codeword MIMO transmission transport format and/or HARQ information for multiple code words may be included. 0070 For uplink resource assignments (on the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)) signaled on PDCCH in LTE, the L1/L2 control information does not containa HARQ process number, since a synchronous HARO\n",

      "protocol is employed for LTE uplink. The HARQ process to be used for US 2014/0029537 A1 an uplink transmission is given by the timing. Furthermore it should be noted that the redundancy version (RV) informa tion is jointly encoded with the transport format information, i.e. the RV info is embedded in the transport format (TF) field. The Transport Format (TF) respectively modulation and cod ing scheme (MCS) field has for example a size of 5 bits, which corresponds to 32 entries. 3 TF/MCS table entries are reserved for indicating redundancy versions (RVs) 1, 2 or 3. The remaining MCS table entries are used to signal the MCS level (TBS) implicitly indicating RV0. The size of the CRC field of the PDCCH is 16 bits. 0071. For downlink assignments (PDSCH) signaled on PDCCH in LTE the Redundancy Version (RV) is signaled separately in a two-bit field. Furthermore the modulation order information is jointly encoded with the transportformat information. Similar to the uplink case there is 5 bit MCS field signaled on PDCCH. 3 of the entries are reserved to signal an explicit modulation order, providing no Transport format (Transport block) info. For the remaining 29 entries modula tion order and Transport block size info are signaled. Resource Allocation Fields for Uplink Resource Assignments 0072 According to 3GPP TS 36.212 v10.0.0, the DCI formats 0 can, for example, be used for uplink resources assignments. The DCI formats 0 contains—amongst oth ers—a so-called “resource block assignment and hopping resource allocation” field, which has a size of log. (N.' (N'+1)/2) bits, where madenotes the number of resource blocks in the uplink. LTE-(A) presently foresees three pos sible uplink resource allocation schemes, which are single cluster allocation with non-hopping PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared channel), single-cluster allocation with hop ping PUSCH and multi-cluster allocation. Multi-cluster allo cation is introduced in Release 10 and is only supported as with non-hopping PUSCH. 0073. In case of a single-cluster allocation with non-hop ping PUSCH, the entire “resource block assignment and hop ping resource allocation” field of the DCI is used to signal the resource allocation in the uplink Sub-frame. 0074. In case of a single-cluster allocation with hopping PUSCH, the N, MSB (most significant bits) of the field are used to specify the detailed hopping configuration, while the remainder of the field provides the resource allocation in the first slot in the uplink sub-frame. Nz can thereby be determined from the system bandwidth according to table 1. Table 1 is obtained from table 8.4-1 of 3GPP TS 36.213 v10.0.1, which is incorporated herein by reference. The sys tem bandwidth N' denotes the number of uplink physical resource blocks. TABLE 1. System Number of Hopping bits Bandwidth for second slot RA N.' NUL hop 6-49 1 SO-110 0075. In case of a multi-cluster allocation with non-hop ping PUSCH, the uplink resource allocation is signaled using the concatenation of the frequency hopping flag field and the resource block assignment and hopping resource allocation field of the DCI. Jan. 30, 2014 0076. The case of multi-cluster allocation with hopping PUSCH is not defined in\n",

      "LTE. For this reason, the frequency hopping flag field (as required for single-cluster allocation) can be used for signaling uplink resource allocation in case of multi-cluster allocation. 0077. For multi-cluster allocations, (\"I bits are required to denote or specify all allowed and Sup ported combinations. According to 3GPP LTE(-A) multi cluster allocation, the Smallest unit of uplink resources that can be assigned is one “resource block group' (RBG) as outlined below in more details. 0078. The size of the RBG can be determined from the system bandwidth according to table 2. Table 2 is obtained from table 7.1.6.1-1 of 3GPP TS 36.213 v10.0.1 by replacing NP with N' accordingly. The system bandwidth N' denotes the number of uplink physical resource blocks. TABLE 2 System Bandwidth RBG Size Noa' (P) s10 1 11-26 2 27-63 3 64-110 4 Multi-Cluster Allocation Interpretation 0079. As mentioned above, hopping is not supported for LTE multi-cluster RBA. The hopping flag of the DCI is there fore prepended to the RBA field, which increases the size by 1 bit. While for single-cluster the allocation is based on a resource-block granularity, for multi-cluster allocations the granularity is based on a resource block group (RBG). An RBG is the union of Padjacent RBs, where P can be estab lished using Table 2 for any uplink system bandwidth sup ported by LTE. The only exception is the case where N' is not an integer multiple of P. and where therefore the last RBG contains the remaining RBs. Each RB is part of only one RBG. The number of uplink RBGsNo' can then be com puted as 0080. As multi-cluster allocation is known and defined in 3GPP LTE Release 10, further details of the RBGs and the allowed combination of RBs (which form the RBGs) that are Supported by the system are not required and therefore omit ted. The multi-cluster allocation according to 3GPP LTE Release 10 and specifically the DCI format 0 for signaling the multi-cluster resource allocation as defined in 3GPP TS 36.212 V10.0.0 is incorporated herein by reference. I0081. According to 3GPP LTE Release 10, multi-cluster allocations are restricted to Support only two clusters, where US 2014/0029537 A1 the first cluster is identified by the starting RBG so and ending RBG S-1, and where the second cluster is identified by the starting RBGS and ending RBGS-1. These four parameters are then linked into a single value r which represents the multi-cluster allocation by the following formula: where M-4 (corresponding the four starting and ending RBGs that define a multi-cluster consisting of two clusters), N=N-1 and 1sso-s-s-s-sN, and where X ()-Christ X > y I0082. Furthermore, 3GPP LTE Release 10 requires that the two clusters are non-adjacent, i.e. there is a spacing of at least one RBG between the end of the first cluster and the start of the second cluster. This conditions leads to the above formula and the inequality relations between values so s,s, Ss. 0083. The present invention has recognized that for most cases (i.e. for most values of the uplink system bandwidth define by the specification\n",

      "3GPP TS 36.213), the number of available bits in the DCI and required bits to denote all allowed RBG allocation combinations supported by the sys tem are matching. However, for Some cases an insufficient number of bits is available in the DCI as outlined above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 0084. The invention is intended to overcome one or more of the discussed and outlined problems of known resource allocation concepts of mobile communication systems or to improve the signaling of the known resource allocation con cepts. 0085. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method for signaling resource allocation informa tion to a terminal of a mobile communication system used for assigning resources to the terminal, as well as a correspond ing terminal and a corresponding base station. I0086. This object is solved by the subject matter of the independent claims. 0087 Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined by the dependent claims. 0088. The present invention has recognized that situations can occur, in which the number of bits available for signaling the resource assignment information is insufficient to repre sent the allowed resource assignments that are Supported by the communication system. In case of LTE, the “allowed resource assignments’ can be the different RBG (i.e., the allowed combinations of RBs) resource allocations that are Supported by the system for multi-cluster allocation. 0089. A first embodiment of the invention concerns a method performed by a terminal of a mobile communication system to receive and determine resource allocation informa tion that indicates to the terminal assigned resources for the terminal. The terminal receives, according to this embodi ment, downlink control information (DCI), which comprises Jan. 30, 2014 a field for indicating a resource allocation for the terminal. This resource assignment field within the DCI has a prede termined number of bits. The terminal determines its assigned resource allocation information from the content of that field in the received DCI, even though—at least for one or more specific resource allocation cases—the predetermined bit size of the resource allocation field in the received DCI is insuf ficient to represent all allowed resource allocations that are Supported by the communication system. According to this embodiment, it is therefore suggested that the received bits that are signaled to the terminal in the mentioned field of the DCI represent predetermined (subset of) bits of the resource allocation information. All remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not included in the field of the received DCI are set to predetermined value, e.g., to either 1 or 0. 0090 The DCI used to signal the resource allocation infor mation can have a predetermined format, in which case the number of bits of the field that is used for signaling the resource allocation information in the DCI can be predefined for any allowed bandwidths supported by the system. This implies that the terminal is able to determine the expected bit size of the signaled resource allocation information (i.e., the size of the field within the received DCI containing the resource allocation information).\n",

      "0091 Another embodiment of the invention concerns a method of transmitting resource allocation information for assigning resources to a terminal of a mobile communication system. For this, a base station determines the resource allo cation information to be transmitted to the terminal. The base station can further determine the number of bits that are available for signaling the resource allocation information within the downlink control information (DCI). The number of available bits can thereby be the size of one or more field(s) for transmitting resource allocation information within the DCI. The number of bits that are available for signaling the resource allocation information (i.e., the bit size of the men tioned field within the DCI) is predetermined for a given bandwidth (and can therefore be determined by the base station, and by the terminal as soon as it is aware of the relevant bandwidth). 0092. If the number of available bits for signaling the resource allocation information is insufficient to represent the plurality of allowed resource allocations, the base station transmits a predetermined subset of bits of the resource allo cation information within the field of the DCI to said terminal. All remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not, or cannot be, transmitted to the terminal have a predetermined value or are set to a predeter mined value. 0093. According to a specific embodiment of the invention the mobile communication system is a 3GPP LTE system or 3GPP LTE-A system. In this case, the terminal is a user equipment (UE) or a relay node. Likewise, the base station is an evolved Node B(eNodeB) or a relay node. The DCI format in this case can be the DCI format 0 as defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. Alternatively, DCI format 4 as defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A may be used for some embodi ments of the invention. 0094. The aforementioned remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not signaled in said field of said DCI can be the most significant bit(s), MSBs, or the least significant bit(s), LSBs, of said resource alloca tion information. US 2014/0029537 A1 0095. Further, the position and/or the value of these remaining one or more bits within the resource allocation information can either be predefined (e.g. in the system according to a technical requirements specification), or pre determined by the base station and then signaled to the ter minal. 0096. Further embodiments of the inventions concern 3GPP LTE, where the resource allocation information repre sents the allocation of resource blocks, RBS, according to a single-cluster resource allocation in DCI format 0 or DCI format 4 defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A. 0097 Alternatively or additionally, the resource allocation information can represent the allocation of resource block groups, RBGs, according to a multi-cluster resource alloca tion in DCI format 0 or DCI format 4 defined in 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A, where an RBG comprises a predefined plural ity of adjacent RBs. 0098. It is further foreseen according to an embodiment of the invention\n",

      "Chunk 14: Length = 512\n",
      "that the value and the positions of said remain ing one or more bits of the resource allocation information (that are not signaled in the field of the DCI) are predeter mined in order to limit the number or combinations of RBs that are assignable to said terminal. 0099. Alternatively, the value and the positions of the remaining one or more bits can be predetermined to limit the number or combinations of RBGs that are assignable to the terminal. 0100. According to this embodiment of the invention, the predetermined value and the predetermined positions of the remaining one or more bits can be chosen so as to exclude an allocation of one or more edge physical resource blocks, PRBs, for example useable by the communication system for physical uplink control channel, PUCCH, transmissions. It may further be advantageous to exclude an allocation of one or more edge physical resource blocks since this reduces the amount of generated out-of-band interference, i.e. power that is leaked outside of the allowed bandwidth. 0101. Further embodiments of the invention propose a re-interpretation or re-mapping scheme for the signaled resource allocation information that is applied by the base station and/or the terminal to change the RBs, RBGs or the combinations thereof that are assignable to said terminal. 0102 This re-interpretation scheme can include a mirror ing from low RB or RBG indices to high RB or RBG indices, respectively, and vice versa. Alternatively or additionally, the re-interpretation scheme can include a shift of the signaled resource allocation information by a predetermined offset, wherein the offset is defined as a number of RBs or RBGs. 0103) The re-interpretation scheme can be configured by a base station or can be signaled by said base station to said terminal. 0104. According to a further embodiment of the invention is a method of transmitting resource allocation information for assigning uplink resources to a terminal of a 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system provided. The method is performed by a base station or relay node. The base station is configured to transmit resource allocation information within a field of downlink control information, DCI, to the terminal. The resource allocation information can thereby represent different resource block groups, RBGs, according to a multi-cluster resource allocation in said 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system. The available bit size of the field of the DCI used for transmitting the resource allocation information is thereby sufficient to represent a Jan. 30, 2014 plurality of possible uplink resource allocations, because the RBG size is determined according to a novel manner. 0105. The RBG size according to this embodiment of the invention can be determined for a given number of uplink resource blocks according to: Noa' Preo.\" s6, 8 1 7, 9-26 2 27-54 3 55-84,91-100 4 85-90, 101-110 5 0106 Alternatively, the RBG size according to this embodiment of the invention can be determined for a given number of uplink resource blocks according to: Noa' Preo.\" s6 1 7-26 2 27-54 3 SS-84 4 85-110 5 I0107.

According to still a further embodiment of the invention is method of receiving resource allocation informa tion for assigning uplink resources to a terminal of a 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system provided. The method is performed by the terminal or relay node. The ter minal is configured to receive downlink control information, DCI that comprises a field for signaling the resource alloca tion information of said terminal. This field has a predeter mined number of bits and the resource allocation information represents resource block groups, RBGs, according to a multi-cluster resource allocation in Said 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system. The bit size of the field of the DCI used for signaling the resource allocation information is thereby sufficient to represent a plurality of possible uplink resource allocations, because the RBG size is determined according to a novel manner. The manner of determining the RBG size for a given number of uplink resource blocks is based on either of the two tables shown above. 0109 According to yet another embodiment of the inven tion is terminal provided for receiving resource allocation information for assigning resources to said terminal within a mobile communication system. The terminal comprises means for receiving downlink control information, DCI that comprises a field for indicating the resource allocation infor mation of the terminal. The field has a predetermined number of bits. The terminal further comprises means for determining the resource allocation information from the bits of the field in the received DCI. The predetermined number of bits of the field in the received DCI is thereby insufficient to represent the plurality of allowed resource allocations that are sup ported by the communication system, e.g. insufficient to rep resent the plurality of allowed multi-cluster resource alloca tions. Therefore, it is suggested that the bits of the field in the received DCI represent predetermined bits of the resource US 2014/0029537 A1 allocation information, while all remaining one or more bits of the resource allocation information that are not included in the field of the received DCI are set to predetermined value. 0110.

The base station comprises means for determining resource allocation information that is to be transmitted to the terminal. The base station further com prises means for determining the number of available bits for signalling the resource allocation information within down link control information, DCI. The number of available bits is thereby the size of the field for transmitting resource alloca tion information within said DCI.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 0121. This section will describe various embodiments of the invention. For exemplary purposes only, most of the Jan. 30, 2014 embodiments are outlined in relation to an orthogonal single carrier uplink radio access scheme according to 3GPP LTE (such as Release 8 or 9) and LTE-A (such as Release 10) mobile communication systems discussed in the Technical Background section above. It is to be noted that the invention may be advantageously used in connection with a mobile communication system such as 3GPP LTE and LTE-A com munication systems previously described, but the invention is not limited to this particular exemplary communication sys tem. I0122) The details given herein of 3GPP LTE and LTE-A are intended to provide a better understanding of the invention and should not be understood as limiting the invention to the described specific implementation details of the described mobile communication system. I0123. As discussed above, the invention has recognized that situations can occur, in which the number of bits available for signaling the resource assignment information is insuffi cient to represent the allowed resource assignments that are Supported by the communication system. In case of LTE multi-cluster allocation, the allowed resource\n",

      "assignments are the different RBG (i.e., the allowed combinations of RBs) allocation combinations that are Supported by the system. 0.124 For the specific case of LTE multi-cluster alloca tions according to DCI format 0, the number of bits for the resource allocation field that are required to address all allowed RBG combinations is (as explained above) (\"I The bits available in the DCI to signal the uplink resource allocation to the terminal can be computed from log2(N.' (N'--1)/2)+1, where the \"+1\" is the result of using the “frequency hopping field flag as discussed in the back ground section and as specified in 3GPP LTE-A Release 10. (0.125 For most numeric cases covered by the 3GPP LTE specification for multi-cluster allocation, the number of avail able bits and required bits shows no problem. However, in some cases not sufficient bits are available, as shown in FIG. 6 0.126 Specifically, FIG. 6 shows the number bits available within DCI format 0 for specifying the allocated RBG and the number of required bits to specify all allowed RBG combi nations as supported and defined by 3GPP LTE, Release 10, for multi-cluster allocation. I0127. As can be obtained from FIG. 6 or the above given formulas, the number of bits available in the DCI format 0 is insufficient for the following number of N': 7, 9, 10, 55-63, 85-90, 101-110 (where only the range from 6-110has been regarded exemplarily and for simplicity). As noted above, N' denotes the system bandwidth in terms of the number of physical uplink resource blocks. I0128. For the 3GPP LTE-(A) specification, the currently Supported system bandwidth for uplink transmissions ranges from 6 to 110, while at least the values 5, 15, 25, 50, 75 and 100 are currently commonly used values. Thus, for com monly used system bandwidths the number of available bits in the DCI is sufficient to represent all allowed resource allocations. 0129. These “allowed’ resource allocations are the allo cations that are Supported by the technical specifications of US 2014/0029537 A1 LTE(-A). For single-cluster allocation, the allowed resource allocations are the different sets of uplink resource blocks that are assignable to the UEs and supported by the LTE(-A) system. More specifically, for single-cluster allocation, the assigned uplink resources are each adjacent uplink resource blocks (RBs). The assigned uplink resources are specified in the DCI by the first RB and the length of the uplink resource, i.e. the number RBs. The first RB and length information are combined into a resource indication value RIV, as provided by TS36.213 v10.0.1 section 8.1.1, that is to be signaled in the DCI. Additionally, the DCI includes a flag for indicating whether frequency hopping is used for the allocation. 0130. For multi-cluster allocation, the allowed resource allocations are the different combinations of uplink resource block groups (RBGs) that are assignable to the UEs and supported by the LTE(-A) system. More specifically, LTE multi-cluster allocation Supports multi-cluster allocation with two clusters, where each cluster is a chunk of adjacent RBGs (and therefore RBs) and where the two clusters are separated by at least one\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 18: Length = 512\n",
      "RBG (as noted above and specified in LTE-A release 10). Thus, the plurality of different allowed resource allocations for multi-cluster allocation can be seen as all different combinations of RBGs within two clusters that are supported by the LTE-A specification. As noted before, the assigned multi-cluster allocation according to LTE Release 10 is signaled as one value r that is determined based on the beginning and ending RB of the two clusters according a rule defined in the LTE-A specification (e.g., TS 36.213 v10.0.1 section 8.1.2). As also noted above, the LTE-A speci fication further defines that the hopping flag of the DCI used for single-cluster allocation is to be also used when signaling the multi-cluster allocation information r. 0131 For future releases, the allowed number of clusters may be greater than two and multi-cluster allocation may be introduced for downlink resource allocation too. However, the allowed resource allocations, i.e. the different RBs or RBGs, and a manner to signal them to the UEs in DCI will also be provided by future releases. The number of bits that are required to represent all allowed resource allocations is given by and can unambiguously determined from the tech nical specification itself. 0.132. According to the example of FIG. 6., one or two additional resource information bits would be required (i.e. for bandwidths 7, 9, 10, 55-63, 85-90, 101-110) to be able to address all allowed RBGs that are supported by LTE, i.e. to represent all allowed values of the multi-cluster allocation information r. 0133. Since the number of bits is predefined by the LTE technical specification (as outlined above), the UE can deter mine the size of the signaled resource allocation information by itself, or the UE can be pre-configured to a given resource allocation information size. In other words, the LTE technical specification requires that for a given bandwidth (e.g., N'-7 in the example of FIG. 6) the resource allocation information (e.g., the value r) has a certain bit-size (e.g., 7 in the example of FIG. 6 for N'-7). Likewise, the LTE specification defines the DCI format including the size of field for signaling the resource allocation information to the UE. If this size is insufficient to representall allowed values r, the UE expects to receive resource allocation information with a certain bit size, but the actually received information in the DCI has a smaller bit-size. The UE behavior for handling Such a situation is not specified and therefore is undefined. The UE preferably ignores the whole received information in Jan. 30, 2014 this undefined situation to avoid behavior that negatively affects the terminal or system performance. I0134) To resolve the problem of insufficient bits in the DCI to representall allowed assignable resource allocations (e.g., for bandwidths 7, 9, 10, 55-63, 85-90, 101-110 in FIG. 6), the straightforward solution is to add the additionally required one or more bits to the respective field in the DCI so that all assignable resource allocations can be expressed and signaled to the UE. 0.135 However, this feasible solution has the drawback that it would not be\n",

      "backward compatible to earlier LTE releases (e.g., releases 8 and 9), specifically to UEs that are manufactured to conform to those releases only. Moreover, it has the disadvantage that the resource allocation information signaled to the UE as part of the DCI has different sizes (i.e., different numbers of bits) for single-allocation and for mul tiple cluster allocation, which adds Substantial complexity because an additional DCI size that needs to be detected increases the blind decoding efforts required to detect the DCI at the UE. 0.136 The invention proposes a different solution to this problem caused by insufficient available bits in the DCI, including but not limited to LTE multi-cluster allocations according to DCI format 0. The proposed solution does not increase the number of bits used in the transmitted DCI for signaling the allocated resources, for example assigned RBGs for LTE multi-cluster allocations according to DCI format 0. and thereforekeeps the DCI detection complexity at the UE at the same level. 0.137 According to one embodiment of the invention, only as many bits of the resource allocation information as can be sent in the DCI are signaled to the UE if the number of available bits in the DCI is insufficient. All remaining bits of the resource allocation information (i.e. those bits for which additional bits would be required as discussed above) are assumed to be, or set to, a predefined value. In other words, these remaining bits of the resource allocation information (for example representing the value r discussed above for multi-cluster allocation) that cannot be signaled in the DCI due to insufficient bits are set to either 0 or 1. The “resource allocation information' in this context is the information required to represent all allocations (e.g., all RBGs for multi cluster allocation) that are supported by the LTE specifica tion. 0.138 Consequently, it is suggested to provide a new inter pretation of the signaled bits at the transmitter (eNodeB) and receiver (UE) sides so that the known and unchanged DCI format can nonetheless be used to signal a meaningful resource allocation information. (0.139. In the following, this approach for 3GPP LTE multi cluster allocation using DCI format 0 is developed. For this, the following mathematical properties are used: (Equation 1) 0140. It can be noted that each of these terms is 0 or a positive integer number for any non-negative integers Xandy. As the invention is concerned with uplink or downlink resource allocations, these conditions are always fulfilled. US 2014/0029537 A1 0141. To analyze the value r, it is helpful to analyze the relationship between the two first terms (\" \") and (, ) Assuming that N-SoeM and N-SeM-1, it is possible to write these terms as N - So N - S1 (\" \") and (, ) M - 1 respectively. 0142. The first term can be converted according to Equa tion 1 to: N - So N - (So + 1) N - (So + 1) ( -( )+( M - 1 }. Therefore, the following applies: (\".\") (. ) st M - 1 0144) Equality holds\n",

It becomes therefore evident that applies, unless one of those terms equals Zero. Specifically, the case that the first term is not the largest value can only occur if 0.148.

To determine the largest value of r, it is sufficient to consider those cases where each term is non-zero. Then, in this specific case, r can be expressed as: -(-)-(, )-(-)-() 0151. Each term becomes largest if the N-s, term is as large as possible, i.e. in the following case: 0153. Moreover, for the maximum value ofr that can result for the Supported resource allocations, applies. 0154) when Furthermore, the largest values of r are obtained | N-so A M is largest, i.e. for so-1. Jan. 30, 2014 (O155 In LTE(-A), the edge PRBs (physical resource blocks) are likely used, configured, reserved or occupied for PUCCH (physical uplink control channel) transmissions. Therefore, the likelihood of assigning the edge PRBs (at both sides of the spectrum) is quite low. It follows that the prob ability that these edge PRBs (for example all RBGs that contain the edge PRBs) are allocated in a multi-cluster allo cation is comparably low. Furthermore, not using edge PRBs reduces the out-of-band emissions generated by transmis sions, so is advantageous even if those PRBs are not used configured, reserved or occupied for PUCCH transmissions. 0156 The largest signaled values for multi-cluster alloca tions occur when the start of the first cluster is in RBG 1, i.e. in the first RBG of the uplink bandwidth. The smallest sig naled values for multi-cluster allocations cannot be so easily predicted. 0157 For example, if the uplink system bandwidth is 7 PRBs, the following values apply: NE = 7 P = 1 Nia = 7 N = 8 1 s So < S < S2 < S3 is 8 8 - So 8 - S1 8-S2 8-S3 -- -- -- () ()() () ()-1-6) ina. F 4 u 0158 Consequently, for the example that the uplink sys tembandwidth is 7 PRBs, seventy different values rexist (0 to 69). These different values of r are the allowed uplink resource allocations Supported by the system. To represent seventy allowed values, 7 bits are required. 0159 For these parameters of the exemplary system band width of 7 PRBs, the equation provides that only 6 bits are available for\n",

      "the signaling of r, even though 7 bits would be required to cover all seventy allowed r values. The seventy allowed values and the corre sponding RBG multi-cluster allocations of this example are shown in Table 2. (0160. It can further be observed from Table 2 that the values 64-69 (shown in italics) have in common that the first RBGs of the first clusteris RBG number 1, i.e. the first RBG of the system bandwidth. These states therefore correspond to those valid states where the MSB (i.e. the bit representing decimal 64) of r is set to 1. On the other hand, it can be observed that the states that are represented by the LSB of r set to 0 (shown in bold) share no similar characteristic, for example they do not share any identical starting or ending RBG of either cluster.

According to another embodiment of the invention, it is further proposed that: 0.165. The eNodeB, when determining the multi-cluster allocation, avoids assigning multi-cluster allocations that cannot be transmitted in the DCI. In other words, only those allocations are determined for which the MSB(s), where applicable, are 0. In this case, there is no need to inform the UE of the value of the MSB(s), as it assumes them to be Zero according to this invention. Alternatively, the UE can be informed of the value of the MSB(s), for example as part of control information sig naled to the UE. 0166 The following advantages are obtained for these embodiments: 0.167 Multi-cluster allocations can be supported for all values of the system bandwidth Na', even if insuffi cient bits are available to signal the unrestricted range of values of r (0168 Only allocations where the first RBG of the allo cation is on the first RBG of the uplink system band width cannot be realized. However, it is expected that the first RBG is typically not assigned due to the aspects mentioned above, so that the relative loss to the system is comparably negligible. (0169. Some allocations where the first RBG of the allo cation is on the first RBG of the uplink system band width can still be realized (for example by signaling values of r between 35 and 63): (0170. In contrast, if for example the MSB was set to 1, only allocations 64-69 could be signaled, which is a comparatively strong restriction to the usability of multi-cluster resource allocation. 0171 In\n",

      "Chunk 22: Length = 512\n",
      "contrast, if for example the LSB was set to either 0 or 1, only 35 out of the above 70 cases of Table 2 could be signaled, which is also putting strong restrictions on the usability of multi-cluster resource allocation. Moreover, these allocations do not follow a particular pattern. 0172. In contrast, if only a a-priori defined restricted part of the bandwidth can be addressed by multi cluster allocations, it follows that for example the first RBG can never be assigned for multi-cluster alloca tions. In the example of Table 2, this would affect configurations 35-69 that would not be usable, i.e. 50% of the cases. 0173 According to another embodiment of the invention the same approach as outlined above is applied, i.e. to set the non-signaled MSB bits to Zero. However, in addition the interpretation of the signaled values is modified. For example, the last RBG can be blocked from being assignable instead of the first RBG as in the above example. This approach is a mirroring of the signaled allocations and can be achieved by are-mapping of the signaled information, Such as the signaled values so to s denoting the two clusters of RBGs for LTE multi-cluster allocation. The re-mapping can be achieved according to a further embodiment of the invention by the following equations: sapplied-N-1-signalled sapplied-N-1-signalled US 2014/0029537 A1 applied signailed S2 N+1-s sapplied-N+1-signalled 0.174. According to still another embodiment, the mirror ing can be also obtained by defining a re-interpretation of the r values. For the above example of Table 3, Table 4 shows possible relations, which are obtained from the above rules for re-interpreting the values so to S and the rule for obtaining an r-value from the values so to S. discussed above.

This embodiment is particularly advantageous if for example the last RBG consists of fewer PRBs than the first RBG. For example, assuming that N'-85, then the exem plary reinterpretation illustrated in Table 4 definition and a RBG size of P-4 (i.e., the RBG has 4 PRBs) one can deter mine that N'-22. Preferably, N'-1=21 RBGs are each set to a size of P-4 and the remaining 22\" RBG is composed of\n",

      "only of 1 PRB. Generally, it is possible that either all RBGs will be of the same size P (if N' is an integer multiple of P), or N'-1 will be of size Pandone \"irregular RBG will be of size in the range {1,2,..., P-1}. This occurs usually if N' is not an integer multiple of P. 0176 It can be noted that the loss for the system is mini mum if the “irregular RBG cannot be assigned by multiple cluster allocations. However, this loss applies to multi-cluster allocation only and the PRBs of the “irregular RBG can still be assigned by single-cluster allocations, or by multi-cluster allocations that do not employ this re-interpretation, e.g. by other UES. (0177 Preferably, the “irregular RBG is either the first or the last RBG. If it is the first RBG, the approach without re-interpretation is beneficial, while in the other case, the approach including the re-interpretation of the signaled value can be advantageously applied. 0.178 According to still another embodiment, the re-inter pretation step can be applied by adding an offset to the sig naled r-value, i.e. applying r'PP=r8'+re. For example, re-r-r'8' with ris' as the maximum value that can be signaled with the available bits. Alternatively, ris' can be configured by the eNodeB and/or signaled to the UE. The advantage of is the simplicity of an implementation. 0179. As a simple (from implementation perspective) but not as effective alternative approach, the re-interpretation can consist of Subtracting the signaled value from the maximum value re'r-r's', i.e. in the above example to use rapplied 69-signated 0180 According to another embodiment of the invention, the re-interpretation to be applied could also be configured or signaled from the eNodeB. With such signaling, the flexibility of the possible assignments by eNodeB is increased, at the cost of more complex implementation at the UE side and possibly also at the transmitter side. In another aspect of this embodiment the re-interpretation behavior is configured by the base station for each UE individually and is signaled to same e.g. using higher layer signaling Such as RRC or MAC signaling in the context of LTE or LTE-A. For example, a first UE is configured without re-interpretation, while a second UE is configured with re-interpretation. Then, the first RBG can be allocated to the second UE and the last RBG can be allocated to the first UE in the same subframe using multi US 2014/0029537 A1 cluster allocations each, so that all RBGs in the system can actually be utilized simultaneously from a system perspec tive. 0181. In regard to the embodiments of the invention con cerning the proposed re-interpretation aspects, DCI format 0 or DCI format 4 of 3GPP LTE(-A), for example Release 10, may be used. Both DCI formats concern multi-cluster allo cation as discussed above. 0182 FIG. 7 shows an exemplary method for receiving and determining resource allocation information at a terminal of a mobile communication system as it can be used in regard to the discussed embodiments of the present invention. 0183. The exemplary method of FIG. 7 can be\n",

      "performed by a terminal, such as a UE or a relay node in an LTE or UMTS system. The terminal receives control information that indicates allocated resources, such as allocated RBS or RBGs for uplink or downlink transmissions of the terminal. The allocated resources can be received as part of a DCI, as illustrated by step 701. 0184 The terminal will then extract the bits of the signaled resource allocation information from the received control information, as shown by step 703. In case of LTE, the DCI includes dedicated fields and/or flags for indicating at least the allocated resources (i.e., RBs or RBGs), as discussed above. Typically, the received resource allocation informa tion represents one or more bit-values that indicate the allo cated resources to the terminal as discussed above. 0185. The terminal determines in step 705 the allocated resource information from the received and extracted bits. As discussed above, steps 703 and 705 can be one and the same step, if the signaled information (e.g., the signaled bits in the resource allocation field of the DCI) specifies directly the allocated resource, as in prior systems discussed in the back ground section. According to embodiments of the invention, there could be insufficient bits available for signaling all allowed combinations of the allocated resources, in which case, the signaled bits received by the terminal do not directly indicate the allocated resource as discussed above. For some embodiments of the invention, non-signaled bits are set to a predefined value. In this case, the terminal can set these non-signaled bits according to the predefined scheme (that can be fixed at the terminal or signaled to the UE) as part of step 705 to result at the actual resource allocation informa tion. Alternatively, the terminal is configured to interpret the received bits according to the predefined scheme to identify actual allocated resource without actively setting the non signaled bits to a given value. In different embodiments of the invention, the signaled number of bits is sufficient to repre sent the allowed resource allocation and the steps 703 and 705 can be one step. 0186. As an optional step 707, the terminal can apply a re-interpretation or re-mapping of the signaled and received resource allocations can be applied according to the discussed re-interpretation embodiments of the invention. As also dis cussed, the re-interpretation can be also signaled to the ter minal, in which case an additional step of receiving and extracting an re-interpretation flag can be performed, either separately to or as part of steps 703 and 705. 0187 FIG. 7A shows exemplary steps that can be per formed as part of the determining step 705 of FIG. 7 accord ing to another embodiment of the present invention. As noted above, the terminal can determine the format and size of the received DCI, including the number (and location) of the bits used for signaling resource allocations. The number of Sig Jan. 30, 2014 naled bits is also referred to as the “number of available bits' in the above description of the different aspects of the present invention.\n",

      "As it is also discussed above, the terminal is further able to determine the number of bits that is required to address or signal all allowed resource allocations that are Supported by the communication system. As such, the terminal can determine whether the signaled bits (i.e., the number of bits in the received DCI that are extracted in step 703 of FIG. 7) is sufficient to representall allowed resource allocations that are Supported by the communication system, as illustrated in step 710 of FIG 7A. 0188 If the number of signaled bits is sufficient, the extracted bits of step 703 of FIG. 7 are determined to be the resource allocation information, as shown in step 712 of FIG. 7A. 0189 If the number of signaled bits is insufficient, the extracted bits of step 703 of FIG. 7 are only one part of the resource allocation information. In this case, as shown by step 714, the predetermined one or more bits that are not signaled to the terminal (also referred to as the “remaining bit(s) in the above description of the different aspects of the present inven tion) are then added to the signaled bits as extracted bits in step 703 of FIG. 7. As discussed above, the position and the value of the non-signaled bits that are to be added are prede termined. The result of combining the extracted bits and the predetermined non-signaled bits as illustrated in step 714 is then used as the resource allocation information. Thereafter, the re-interpretation step 707 of FIG. 7 can be performed using the result of either step 712 or step 714. 0.190 FIG. 8 shows an exemplary method for determining and transmitting resource allocation information by a base station of a mobile communication system as it can be used in regard to the discussed embodiments of the present invention. (0191). The exemplary method of FIG. 8 can be performed a base station, such as an eNodeB/NodeB or a relay node in an LTE or UMTS system. The base station determines the assigned resources allocation for a terminal. Such as allocated RBs or RBGs for uplink or downlink transmissions of the terminal, as illustrated by step 801. 0.192 According to step 803, the base station determines whether the number of available bits is sufficient for repre senting the allowed resource allocations Supported by the system as discussed above for several embodiments of the invention. 0193 If the number of available bits is sufficient, the base station can create the DCI in the common manner as illus trated by step 807. 0194 If the number of available bits is insufficient, the base station can set one or more predetermined bits of the resource allocation information (i.e. the resource allocation information that would have to be signaled to address all allowed resource allocations Supported by the system) to a predetermined value, as illustrated by step 809 and discussed above for several embodiments of the invention. 0.195 According to step 811, the base station creates the DCI with those bits to be signaled according to the respective embodiments\n",

      "of the invention. (0196) Steps 803,805 and 809 can be performed once by the base station or only under given circumstances, but not for each control information signaling step. The result can then be applied in multiple Subsequent signaling steps and for creating and transmitting several DCIS to terminal(s) serviced by the base station. Alternatively, the numbers of bits and values determined can be predefined or fixed, in which case US 2014/0029537 A1 steps 803,805 and 809 do not have to be performed by the base station. Moreover, some embodiments of the invention concern the case where there are sufficient bits available, such as the embodiments of the invention concerning the re-inter pretation aspect that can be implemented with and without sufficient bits as discussed above. For these embodiments of the steps 803,805 and 809 may not be performed by the base station. 0197) Once the DCI is created, the base station can trans mit the DCI to the terminal as illustrated in step 813. (0198 The exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 can concern the same communication system in that the DCI received by the terminal in step 701 was transmitted by the base station in step 813. (0199 Instead of setting the MSB(s) of the resource allo cation information (e.g., the allocated RBGs) to 0 as dis cussed above, the bit(s) that are set and/or the value to which they are set can be configured by the eNodeB. 0200 Whethera re-interpretation is applied or not can also be configured by the eNodeB, preferably per UE. According to another embodiment, the status whether re-interpretation is applied is signaled in the control information that carries the resource allocation. This could be achieved by a single bit (on/off). If this bit is taken from the LTE DCI resource allo cation field according to the above example of Table 3, one additional MSB is set to zero. This means that with the earlier outlined example, instead of 6 available bits, 1 bit is used as a re-interpretation flag (on/off), while the remaining 5 bits denote the LSBs of r. Accordingly, the resources that can be assigned to an UE are limited to the values 0-31 of the Table 3. If the re-interpretation bit is set to “off, this means that states 0-31 from the table can be allocated. If the re-interpre tation flag is “on”, this means that states 0-31 can be signaled and a re-interpretation scheme is applied. According to another embodiment of the invention, the re-interpretation bit set to a first value means that a first set of States can be allocated by the available bits, and the re-interpretation bit set to a second value means that a second set of states can be allocated by the available bits. The first and second set of states can be configured and signaled by the base station. 0201 As it has been discussed above, embodiments of the present invention allows to define (preferably per UE) which RBs or RBGs or combinations thereof can actually be addressed with the available number of bits\n",

      "if the signaling is insufficient to assign all allowed RB or RBG combinations in the multi-cluster approach. 0202) However, according to yet another embodiment of the invention, the number of RBGs (e.g., for multi-cluster allocation) or the number of RBS (e.g., for single-cluster allocation) that can be addressed by an available number of bits can be determined and set by the system or the base station. For example, the number of addressable RBGs can be determined by: 3 15 Ngiessable = -- 4. -- w 1 + 24.2\"bits available - 1 0203 Thus, the signaled bits can be interpreted to define a multi-cluster allocation in the range from RBG 1 to RBG N“”. Then, another parameter can be configurable which defines whether a re-interpretation is applied similar to the solutions outlined previously. Those skilled in the art will Jan. 30, 2014 recognize that the given formula can also be applied to deter mine the number of addressable RBs by substituting N.\" ad dressable by Nr. ressapie. 0204. It is to be noted that this embodiment of the inven tion can be used to limit the assignable resource allocations for a UE, even if the available number of signaling bits would be sufficient to address all allowed resource allocations. 0205. In addition, a re-interpretation can be defined such that the RB or RBG indices within the N' RBs are first configured. In case RBs are defined, those RBs are formed to RBGs, where generally non-adjacent RBs may be located in one RBG. The multi-cluster allocation signal is then used to assign RBGs from within this restricted set of RBGs. There is a choice whether the RBG size P is determined from the value N' or N'. The first has the advantage that the RBG size is identical for all UEs under the eNodeB, which simplifies the scheduling algorithm due to only the single RBG size which has to be taken into account. On the other hand, with the second way the granularity of the addressable RBGs is improved, particularly if a very restricted subset of RBs is defined for possible multi-cluster allocations. For example, in a system with N'-50 PRBs, the normal RBG size is P-3. The network could desire or decide to use only 16 out of those 50 PRBs (which for example corresponds to a frequency reuse factor of roughly /3 that is quite common in cellular communication systems). This means for the above mentioned first way that 6 RBGs, each of size 3 PRBs, are selected formulti-cluster allocation. For the abovementioned second way, there would be 8 RBGs of size 2 available for multi-cluster allocation, since for a system of 16 PRBs the RBG size is 2. Thus, the granularity and scheduling flexibility is increased. It can be noted that with the second way, it is possible that again more bits are required than available. However, in Such a case, the present invention has proposed a Solution to signal the allocations. 0206. Since the number of bits required for multi-cluster allocations depends on N' as well as on the RBG\n",

      "Chunk 28: Length = 512\n",
      "size P (which is itself a function of N'), it is also possible to modify the definition of the RBG size P so that the number of available bits is sufficient to hold the multi-cluster allocation for the resulting number of RBGs. 0207. From the available number of bits for the multi cluster allocation, the number of addressable RBGs can be determined by 3 5 Nissable = * W 4 + w 1 + 24.2\"bits,available - 1. Therefore, the RBG size is determined from the number of uplink resource blocks and the number of addressable RBGs is determined by: ii. i. adaressable PRBG NRB /NRBG l. 0208 According to still another of the invention, it is therefore suggested to determining the RBG size for a given number of uplink resource blocks of a 3GPP LTE or 3GPP LTE-A communication system by Table 5 (derived using the above formula) instead of the suggested Table 2 of the 3GPP LTE specification discussed in the background section.

HARQ profile: One HARQ profile consists of a power offset attribute and maximum number of transmissions. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, it also includes a retransmission timer attribute. Power offset attribute (FDD): This represents the power offset between E- DPDCH(s) and reference E-DPDCH power level for a given E-TFC. This power offset attribute is set to achieve the required QoS in this MAC-d flow when carried alone in a MAC-e or MAC-i PDU and subsequently in the corresponding CCTrCh of E-DCH type. Details on the mapping on Beta factors can be found in [13]. The reference E-DPDCH power offset is signalled to the UE for one (or several) reference E-TFC(s) (see details in subclause 11.1). Power offset attribute (TDD): The power offset attribute is set to achieve the required QoS in this MAC-d flow when carried alone in a MAC-e or MAC-i PDU and subsequently in the corresponding CCTrCh of E-DCH type.

According to the RRC functions the RRC is generally in control of the internal configuration of the MAC. Both MAC-hs and MAC-ehs are responsible for handling the data transmitted on the HS-DSCH. Furthermore they are responsible for the management of the physical resources allocated to HS-DSCH. Upper layers configure which of the two entities, MAC-hs or MAC-ehs, is to be applied to handle HS-DSCH functionality. Both MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is are responsible for handling the data transmitted on the E-DCH. Upper layers configure which of the two entities, MAC-e/es or MAC-i/is, is to be applied to handle E-DCH functionality. 4.2.1 MAC Entities The diagrams that describe the MAC architecture are constructed from MAC entities. The entities are assigned the following names. - MAC-b is the MAC\n",
      "Chunk 10: entity that handles the following transport channels: - broadcast channel (BCH) - MAC-c/sh/m, is the MAC entity that handles the following transport channels: - paging channel (PCH) - forward access channel (FACH) - random access channel (RACH) - downlink shared channel (DSCH). The DSCH exists only in TDD mode. - uplink shared channel (USCH). The USCH exists only in TDD mode. - MAC-d is the MAC entity that handles the following transport channels: - dedicated transport channel (DCH) - MAC-hs/ehs is the MAC entity that handles the following transport channels: - high speed downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH) - MAC-m is the MAC entity that handles the following transport channels: - forward access channel (FACH). - MAC-e/es and MAC-i/is are the MAC entities that handle the following transport channels: - enhanced dedicated transport channel (E-DCH). The exact functions completed by the entities are different in the UE from those completed in the UTRAN. NOTE: When a UE is allocated resources for exclusive use by the bearers that it supports the MAC-d entities dynamically share the resources between the bearers and are responsible for selecting the TFI/ TFCI that is to be used in each transmission time interval. 4.2.2 MAC-b The following diagram illustrates the connectivity of the MAC-b entity in a UE and in each cell of the UTRAN. MAC-b represents the control entity for the broadcast channel (BCH). There is one (current cell) or multiple (current and neighbour cells) MAC-b entities in each UE and one MAC-b in the UTRAN for each cell. The MAC Control SAP is used to transfer Control information to MAC-b. The MAC-b entity is located in the Node B. [pic] Figure 4.2.2.1: UE side and UTRAN side architecture 4.2.3 Traffic Related Architecture - UE Side Figure 4.2.3.1 illustrates the connectivity of MAC entities. The MAC-c/sh/m controls access to all common transport channels, except the HS-DSCH transport channel and the E-DCH transport channel (FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD only). The MAC-d controls access to all dedicated transport channels, to MAC- c/sh/m and MAC-hs/ehs. The MAC-c/sh/m controls access to MAC-is/i. (FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD only for UEs in CELL_FACH state and Idle mode). The MAC-hs/ehs handles the HSDPA specific functions and controls access to the HS-DSCH transport channel. Upper layers configure which of the two entities, MAC-hs or MAC-ehs, is to be applied to handle HS-DSCH functionality. The MAC-e/es or MAC-i/is controls access to the E-DCH transport channel. Upper layers configure which of the two entities, MAC-e/es or MAC-i/is, is to be applied to handle E-DCH functionality. In case of selective combining of MTCH channels from multiple cells, the MAC-m controls access to the FACH transport channels used to carry MTCH and MSCH. In the downlink, if logical channels of dedicated type are mapped to common transport channels then MAC-d receives the data from MAC-c/sh/m or MAC- hs/ehs via the illustrated connection between the functional entities. In the downlink, if logical channels of common type are mapped to HS-DSCH then MAC-c/sh/m receives the data from MAC-ehs via the illustrated connection between the functional entities (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only).\n",
      "Chunk 11: In the uplink, if logical channels of dedicated type are mapped to common transport channels then MAC-d submits the data to MAC-c/sh/m and MAC-is/i via the illustrated connection between the functional entities. The mapping of logical channels on transport channels depends on the multiplexing that is configured by RRC. The MAC Control SAP is used to transfer Control information to each MAC entity. The associated signalling shown in the figure illustrates the exchange of information between layer 1 and layer 2 provided by primitives shown in [3]. [pic] Figure 4.2.3.1: UE side MAC architecture 4.2.3.1 MAC-c/sh/m entity – UE Side Figure 4.2.3.1.1 shows the UE side MAC-c/sh/m entity. The following functionality is covered: - TCTF MUX: - this function represents the handling (insertion for uplink channels and detection and deletion for downlink channels) of the TCTF field in the MAC header, and the respective mapping between logical and transport channels. The TCTF field indicates the common logical channel type, or if a dedicated logical channel is used; - add/read UE Id: - the UE Id is added for RACH transmissions; - the UE Id, when present, identifies data to this UE. - read MBMS Id: - the MBMS Id is read in case of MTCH reception; - the MBMS Id identifies received data to an MBMS service. - UL: TF selection: - in the uplink, the possibility of transport format selection exists. - ASC selection: - For RACH, MAC indicates the ASC associated with the PDU to the physical layer. This is to ensure that RACH messages associated with a given Access Service Class (ASC) are sent on the appropriate signature(s) and time slot(s). MAC also applies the appropriate back- off parameter(s) associated with the given ASC. When sending an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message, RRC will determine the ASC; in all other cases MAC selects the ASC; - scheduling /priority handling - this functionality is used to transmit the information received from MAC-d on RACH based on logical channel priorities. This function is related to TF selection. - TFC selection - transport format and transport format combination selection according to the transport format combination set (or transport format combination subset) configured by RRC is performed, The RLC provides RLC-PDUs to the MAC, which fit into the available transport blocks on the transport channels. There is one MAC-c/sh/m entity in each UE. [pic] Figure 4.2.3.1.1: UE side MAC architecture / MAC-c/sh/m details 4.2.3.1b MAC-m entity – UE Side Figure 4.2.3.1b.1 shows the UE side MAC-m entity. The following functionality is covered: - TCTF DEMUX: - this function represents the handling (detection and deletion for downlink channels) of the TCTF field in the MAC header, and the respective mapping between logical and transport channels. The TCTF field indicates the common logical channel type; - read MBMS Id - the MBMS Id is read in case of MTCH reception; - the MBMS Id identifies received data to an MBMS service. The MAC Control SAP is used to transfer control information to MAC-m. If MTCH channels are selectively combined, the MAC-m entity exists in the UE.\n",
      "Chunk 12: Otherwise, the MAC-m entity does not exist. In case of selective combining of MTCH channels from multiple cells, there are one MAC-c/sh/m for the current cell and one MAC-m entity for each neighboring cell in the UE. [pic] Figure 4.2.3.1b.1: UE side MAC architecture / MAC-m details 4.2.3.2 MAC-d entity – UE Side Figure 4.2.3.2.1 shows the UE side MAC-d entity. The following functionality is covered: - Transport Channel type switching - Transport Channel type switching is performed by this entity, based on decision taken by RRC. This is related to a change of radio resources. If requested by RRC, MAC shall switch the mapping of one designated logical channel between common and dedicated transport channels. - C/T MUX: - The C/T MUX is used when multiplexing of several dedicated logical channels onto one transport channel (other than HS-DSCH) or one MAC-d flow (HS-DSCH) is used. An unambiguous identification of the logical channel is included. If MAC-ehs is configured, C/T MUX toward MAC-ehs is not used. - Ciphering: - Ciphering for transparent mode data to be ciphered is performed in MAC-d. Details about ciphering can be found in [10]. - Deciphering: - Deciphering for ciphered transparent mode data is performed in MAC- d. Details about ciphering can be found in [10]. - UL TFC selection: - Transport format and transport format combination selection according to the transport format combination set (or transport format combination subset) configured by RRC is performed. The MAC-d entity is responsible for mapping dedicated logical channels for the uplink either onto dedicated transport channels or to transfer data to MAC-c/sh/m to be transmitted via common channels. One dedicated logical channel can be mapped simultaneously onto DCH and DSCH in TDD mode. One dedicated logical channel can be simultaneously mapped onto DCH and HS- DSCH. The MAC-d entity has a connection to the MAC-c/sh/m entity. This connection is used to transfer data to the MAC-c/sh/m to transmit data on transport channels that are handled by MAC-c/sh/m (uplink) or to receive data from transport channels that are handled by MAC-c/sh/m (downlink). The MAC-d entity has a connection to the MAC-hs or MAC-ehs entity. This connection is used to receive data from the HS-DSCH transport channel which is handled by MAC-hs or MAC-ehs (downlink). The MAC-d entity has a connection to the MAC-e/es or MAC-i/is entity. This connection is used to transmit data on the E-DCH transport channel which is handled by the MAC-e/es or MAC-i/is (uplink). There is one MAC-d entity in the UE. [pic] Figure 4.2.3.2.1: UE side MAC architecture / MAC-d details 4.2.3.3 MAC-hs entity – UE Side In the model below the MAC-hs comprises the following entities. In 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH cell, the associated downlink control channel and uplink control channel pair controlling the HS-DSCH transmission on the certain carrier shall be allocated on the same carrier. The downlink control channel carries the HS-DSCH operation related info and the uplink control channel carries the feedback info from the UE side. - HARQ: The HARQ entity is responsible for handling the MAC functions relating to the\n",
      "Chunk 13: HARQ protocol. The HARQ functional entity handles all the tasks that are required for hybrid ARQ. It is responsible for generating ACKs or NACKs. The detailed configuration of the hybrid ARQ protocol is provided by RRC over the MAC-Control SAP. In 1.28 Mcps TDD multi- frequency HS-DSCH cell, multiple HARQ processes are assigned for HS- DSCH operaton on every carrier independently, namely HARQ sub-entity; only one HARQ process is allowed to receive HS-DSCH in one TTI for each carrier. The maximum number of HARQ process per HS-DSCH per TTI on which an HS-DSCH transmission can be received is one. - Reordering Queue distribution: The reordering queue distribution function routes the MAC-hs PDUs to the correct reordering buffer based on the Queue ID.For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the reordering queue distribution function discards the MAC-hs PDU if the N field in MAC-hs header is zero. - Reordering: The reordering entity reorders received MAC-hs PDUs according to the received TSN. MAC-hs PDUs with consecutive TSNs are delivered to the disassembly function upon reception. MAC-hs PDUs are not delivered to the disassembly function if MAC-hs PDUs with lower TSN are missing. There is one reordering entity for each Queue ID configured at the UE. - Disassembly: The disassembly entity is responsible for the disassembly of MAC-hs PDUs. When a MAC-hs PDU is disassembled the MAC-hs header is removed, the MAC-d PDUs are extracted and any present padding bits are removed. Then the MAC-d PDUs are delivered to higher layer. The associated signalling shown in the figure illustrates the exchange of information between layer 1 and layer 2 provided by primitives shown in [3].

In the model below the MAC-e/es comprises the following entities: - HARQ: The HARQ entity is responsible for handling the MAC functions relating to the HARQ protocol. It is responsible for storing MAC-e payloads and re-transmitting them. The detailed configuration of the hybrid ARQ protocol is provided by RRC over the MAC-Control SAP. - For FDD: The HARQ entity provides the E-TFC, the retransmission sequence number (RSN), and the power offset to be used by L1. Redundancy version (RV) of the HARQ transmission is derived by L1 from RSN, CFN and in case of 2 ms TTI from the sub-frame number. - For TDD: The HARQ entity provides the HARQ process identity, the E- TFC, the retransmission sequence number (RSN) and an indication of the power offset to be used by L1. The redundancy version (RV) of the HARQ transmission is derived by L1 from RSN. RRC signalling can also configure the L1 to use RV=0 for every transmission. - Multiplexing and TSN setting: The multiplexing and TSN setting entity is responsible for concatenating multiple MAC-d PDUs into MAC-es PDUs, and to multiplex one or multiple MAC-es PDUs into a single MAC-e PDU, to be transmitted in the next TTI,\n",

It is also responsible for managing and setting the TSN per logical channel for each MAC-es PDU. - E-TFC selection: This entity is responsible for E-TFC selection according to the scheduling information, Relative Grants (FDD only) and Absolute Grants, received from UTRAN via L1 and Serving Grant value signalled through RRC, and for arbitration among the different flows mapped on the E-DCH. The detailed configuration of the E-TFC entity is provided by RRC over the MAC-Control SAP. The E-TFC selection function controls the multiplexing function. - Scheduling Access Control (TDD only): The Scheduling Access Control entity is responsible for routing associated uplink signalling via E-UCCH and MAC-e PDU (in the case that E-DCH resources are assigned) or via E-RUCCH (in the case that no E-DCH resources are assigned). It is also responsible for obtaining and formatting the appropriate information to be carried on E-UCCH/E-RUCCH. NOTE: HARQ process ID and RSN are carried on E-UCCH.

There shall be one HARQ process per HS-DSCH per TTI for single stream transmission and two HARQ processes per HS-DSCH per TTI for dual stream transmission. There shall be one HARQ entity per HS-DSCH (FDD only). The HARQ functional entity handles all the tasks that are required for hybrid ARQ. It is for example responsible for generating ACKs or NACKs. The detailed configuration of the hybrid ARQ protocol is provided by RRC over the MAC-Control SAP.In 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH cell, multiple HARQ processes are assigned for HS-DSCH operaton on every carrier independently, namely HARQ sub-entity; only one HARQ process is allowed to receive HS-DSCH in one TTI for each carrier. The maximum number of HARQ process per HS-DSCH per TTI on which an HS-DSCH transmission can be received is one. - Disassembly The disassembly entity disassembles the MAC-ehs PDUs by removing the MAC-ehs header and possible padding. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the disassembly entity discards the MAC-ehs PDU if the L field in MAC-ehs header is zero. - Reordering queue distribution The reordering queue distribution function routes the received reordering PDUs to correct reordering queues based on the received logical channel identifier. - Reordering: The reordering entity organises received reordering PDUs according to the received TSN. Data blocks with consecutive TSNs are delivered to reassembly entity upon reception. A timer mechanism determines delivery of non-consecutive data blocks to higher layers. There is one reordering entity for each MAC-ehs Queue ID configured at the UE.\n",
      "Chunk 15: For the logical channels BCCH and PCCH no re-ordering is applied. - Reassembly: The reassembly entity reassembles segmented MAC-ehs SDUs (corresponding to either MAC-c or MAC-d PDUs) and forwards the MAC PDUs to LCH-ID demultiplexing entity. - LCH-ID demultiplexing: The demultiplexing entity routes the MAC-ehs SDUs to correct logical channel based on the received logical channel identifier. The following is allowed: The MAC-ehs SDUs included in a MAC-ehs PDU can have a different size and a different priority and can be mapped to different priority queues.

In the model below the MAC-i/is comprises the following entities: - HARQ: The HARQ entity is responsible for handling the MAC functions relating to the HARQ protocol. It is responsible for storing MAC-i payloads and re-transmitting them. The detailed configuration of the hybrid ARQ protocol is provided by RRC over the MAC-Control SAP. - For FDD: There shall be one HARQ entity per E-DCH. The HARQ entity provides the E-TFC, the retransmission sequence number (RSN), and the power offset to be used by L1. Redundancy version (RV) of the HARQ transmission is derived by L1 from RSN, CFN and in case of 2 ms TTI from the sub-frame number. - For TDD: There shall be one HARQ entity per E-DCH for 1.28Mcps TDD. The HARQ entity provides the HARQ process identity, the E-TFC, the retransmission sequence number (RSN) and an indication of the power offset to be used by L1. The redundancy version (RV) of the HARQ transmission is derived by L1 from RSN. RRC signalling can also configure the L1 to use RV=0 for every transmission. - Multiplexing and TSN setting: The multiplexing and TSN setting entity is responsible for concatenating multiple MAC-d PDUs into MAC-is PDUs, and to multiplex one or multiple MAC-is PDUs into a single MAC-i PDU, or, for FDD when more than one uplink frequency is activated, one or two MAC-i PDUs, to be transmitted in the next TTI, as instructed by the E-TFC selection function, and for 1.28Mcps TDD when multi-carrier E-DCH operation is activated, one or up to 6 MAC-i PDUs, to be transmitted in the next TTI, as instructed by the E-TFC selection function. It is also responsible for managing and setting the TSN per logical channel for each MAC-is PDU. In FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD, the multiplexing and TSN setting entity is responsible for multiplexing MAC-c PDUs or segments of MAC-c PDUs into a single MAC-is PDU, and for multiplexing MAC-is PDUs into a single MAC- i PDU, to be transmitted in the next TTI, as instructed by the E-TFC selection function. It is also responsible for managing and setting the TSN for the common control channel for each MAC-is PDU. - Segmentation: The segmentation function is responsible for segmenting MAC-d PDUs and MAC-c PDUs (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only). - CRC Attachment (FDD\n",
      "Chunk 16: and 1.28 Mcps TDD only): If segmentation is performed for MAC-c PDUs, a CRC is appended to the MAC-c PDU and segmentation is then performed for the entire MAC-c PDU including CRC. The size of the CRC field is 8 bits and the CRC is calculated as specified in section 4.2.1.1 in [16] or [19]. In the CRC field, see Figure 9.1.5.4d , the LSB is the rightmost bit and the MSB is the leftmost bit. - Add UE ID (FDD only): In CELL_DCH state, no E-RNTI is included in the MAC-PDU header. In CELL_FACH, the E-RNTI is added in all MAC-i PDUs for DCCH and DTCH transmission at the UE side until the UE receives an E-AGCH with its E- RNTI (through an E-RNTI-specific CRC attachment). In CELL_FACH state and in Idle mode, no E-RNTI is added in MAC-i PDUs for CCCH data transmission. - E-TFC selection: This entity is responsible for E-TFC selection according to the scheduling information, Relative Grants (FDD only) and Absolute Grants, received from UTRAN via L1 and Serving Grant value signalled through RRC, and for arbitration among the different flows mapped on the E-DCH. The detailed configuration of the E-TFC entity is provided by RRC over the MAC-Control SAP. The E-TFC selection function controls the multiplexing function. - ASC selection (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only): At the start of the Enhanced Uplink in CELL_FACH state and Idle mode, MAC-is/i applies the appropriate back-off parameter(s) associated with the given ASC. When sending an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message, RRC will determine the ASC; in all other cases MAC-is/i selects the ASC. - Scheduling Access Control (TDD only): The Scheduling Access Control entity is responsible for routing associated uplink signalling via E-UCCH and MAC-i PDU (in the case that E-DCH resources are assigned) or via E-RUCCH (in the case that no E-DCH resources are assigned). It is also responsible for obtaining and formatting the appropriate information to be carried on E-UCCH/E-RUCCH. NOTE: HARQ process ID and RSN are carried on E-UCCH.

It is similar to the UE case with the exception that there will be one MAC- d for each UE and each UE (MAC-d) that is associated with a particular cell may be associated with that cell's MAC-c/sh/m. MAC-c/sh/m is located in the controlling RNC while MAC-d is located in the serving RNC. MAC-hs/ehs is located in the Node B. The MAC-d PDUs to be transmitted are transferred from MAC-c/sh/m to the MAC-hs/ehs via the Iub interface in case of configuration with MAC-c/sh/m, or from the MAC-d via Iur/Iub in case of configuration without MAC-c/sh/m.

MAC-es or MAC-is is further connected to MAC-d. There is one transport bearer set up per E-DCH MAC-d flow. For FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD, for DTCH and DCCH transmission in CELL_FACH, for each UE that uses E-DCH, one MAC-i entity per Node-B and one MAC-is entity in the SRNC are configured. MAC-i, located in the Node B, controls access to the E-DCH and is connected to MAC-is, located in the SRNC. MAC-is is further connected to MAC-d. For FDD, for CCCH transmission, for each UE that uses E-DCH, one MAC-i entity per Node-B and one MAC-is entity in the CRNC are configured. MAC-i, located in the Node B, controls access to the E-DCH and is connected to MAC- is in the CRNC. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, for CCCH transmission, for each UE that uses E-DCH, one MAC-i entity per common E-RNTI in Node-B and one MAC-is entity in the CRNC are configured. MAC-i, located in the Node B, controls access to the E-DCH and is connected to MAC-is in the CRNC. The MAC Control SAP is used to transfer Control information to each MAC entity belonging to one UE. The associated signalling shown in the figure illustrates the exchange of information between layer 1 and layer 2 provided by primitives shown in [3].

The following functionality is covered: - Scheduling – Buffering – Priority Handling; - this function manages FACH and for TDD DSCH resources between the UEs and between data flows according to their priority and delay requirements set by higher layers. - TCTF MUX - this function represents the handling (insertion for downlink channels and detection and deletion for uplink channels) of the TCTF field in the MAC header, and the respective mapping between logical and transport channels. The TCTF field indicates the common logical channel type, or if a dedicated logical channel is used; - UE Id Mux; - for dedicated type logical channels, the UE Id field in the MAC header is used to distinguish between UEs; - MBMS Id Mux; - for MTCH channels, the MBMS Id field in the MAC header is used to distinguish between MBMS services; - TFC selection: - in the downlink, transport format combination selection is done for FACH and PCH and for TDD DSCHs; - Demultiplex; - for TDD operation the demultiplex function is used to separate USCH data from different UEs, i.e. to be transferred to different MAC-d entities; - DL code allocation; - for TDD this function is used to indicate the code used on the DSCH; - Flow control; - a flow control function exists toward MAC-d to limit buffering between MAC-d and MAC-c/sh/m entities. a flow control function also exists towards MAC-hs/ehs in case of configuration with MAC-c/sh/m. The RLC provides RLC-PDUs to the MAC,\n",

There is one MAC-c/sh/m entity in the UTRAN for each cell; [pic] Figure 4.2.4.1.1: UTRAN side MAC architecture / MAC-c/sh/m details 4.2.4.2 MAC-d entity – UTRAN Side Figure 4.2.4.2.1 shows the UTRAN side MAC-d entity. The following functionality is covered: - Transport Channel type switching: - Transport Channel type switching is performed by this entity, based on decision taken by RRC; this is related to a change of radio resources. If requested by RRC, MAC shall switch the mapping of one designated logical channel between common and dedicated transport channels. - C/T MUX box; - the function includes the C/T field when multiplexing of several dedicated logical channels onto one transport channel (other than HS- DSCH) or one MAC-d flow (HS-DSCH) is used. If MAC-ehs is configured, C/T MUX toward MAC-ehs is not used. - LCH MUX box; - If MAC-ehs is configured, the LCH MUX function associates each block of MAC-d PDUs of a logical channel with the related LCH-ID, regardless whether one or several logical channels are multiplexed onto one MAC-d flow. - Priority setting; - This function is responsible for priority setting on data received from DCCH / DTCH; - Ciphering; - Ciphering for transparent mode data to be ciphered is performed in MAC-d. Details about ciphering can be found in [10]. - Deciphering; - Deciphering for ciphered transparent mode data is performed in MAC- d. Details about ciphering can be found in [10]. - DL Scheduling/Priority handling; - in the downlink, scheduling and priority handling of transport channels is performed within the allowed transport format combinations of the TFCS assigned by the RRC. - Flow Control; - a flow control function exists toward MAC-c/sh/m to limit buffering between MAC-d and MAC-c/sh/m entities. This function is intended to limit layer 2 signalling latency and reduce discarded and retransmitted data as a result of FACH or for TDD DSCH congestion. For the Iur interface this is specified in [11]. A flow control function also exists towards MAC-hs/ehs in case of configuration without MAC-c/sh/m, see subclause 4.2.4.2. A MAC-d entity using common channels other than the high speed downlink shared channel is connected to a MAC-c/sh/m entity that handles the scheduling of the common channels to which the UE is assigned and DL (FACH) priority identification to MAC-c/sh/m; A MAC-d entity using downlink shared channel is connected to a MAC-c/sh/m entity that handles the shared channels to which the UE is assigned and indicates the level of priority of each PDU to MAC-c/sh/m; A MAC-d entity using the high speed downlink shared channel may be connected to a MAC-c/sh/m entity that in turn is connected to the MAC- hs/ehs entity in the Node B (configuration with MAC-c/sh/m); alternately, a MAC-d entity using the high speed downlink shared channel may be connected to the MAC-hs/ehs entity in the Node B in case of configuration without MAC- c/sh/m. A MAC-d entity using the enhanced dedicated transport channel (Uplink only) is connected to a MAC-es or MAC-is entity that handles the re-ordering and\n",

The MAC-es or MAC-is indicates the logical channel for which the data is intended, to allow the MAC-d to route it appropriately. A MAC-d entity is responsible for mapping dedicated logical channels onto the available dedicated transport channels or routing the data received on a DCCH or DTCH to MAC-c/sh/m or to MAC-hs/ehs. One dedicated logical channel can be mapped simultaneously on DCH and DSCH in TDD mode. Different scheduling mechanisms apply for DCH and DSCH. One dedicated logical channel can be mapped simultaneously on DCH and HS-DSCH. There is one MAC-d entity in the UTRAN for each UE that has one or more dedicated logical channels to or from the UTRAN. [pic] Figure 4.2.4.2.1: UTRAN side MAC architecture / MAC-d details 4.2.4.3 MAC-hs entity – UTRAN Side There is one MAC-hs entity in the UTRAN for each cell that supports HS-DSCH transmission. The MAC-hs is responsible for handling the data transmitted on the HS-DSCH when configured by upper layers. Furthermore, when configured by upper layers, it is responsible for the management of the physical resources allocated to HSDPA. There should be priority handling per MAC-d PDU in the MAC-hs. The MAC-hs is comprised of four different functional entities: - Flow Control: This is the companion flow control function to the flow control function in the MAC-c/sh/m in case of configuration with MAC-c/sh/m and MAC-d in case of configuration without MAC-c/sh/m. Both entities together provide a controlled data flow between the MAC-c/sh/m and the MAC-hs (Configuration with MAC-c/sh/m) or the MAC-d and MAC-hs (Configuration without MAC-c/sh/m) taking the transmission capabilities of the air interface into account in a dynamic manner. This function is intended to limit layer 2 signalling latency and reduce discarded and retransmitted data as a result of HS-DSCH congestion. Flow control is provided independently by MAC-d flow for a given MAC-hs entity. - Scheduling/Priority Handling: This function manages HS-DSCH resources between HARQ entities and data flows according to their priority. Based on status reports from associated uplink signalling either new transmission or retransmission is determined. Further it determines the Queue ID and TSN for each new MAC-hs PDU being serviced, and in the case of TDD the HCSN is determined. A new transmission can be initiated instead of a pending retransmission at any time to support the priority handling.

When configured by the upper layers, the MAC-es sublayer handles E-DCH specific functionality, which is not covered in the MAC-e entity in Node B. In the model below, the MAC-es comprises the following entities: - Reordering Queue Distribution: The reordering queue distribution function routes the MAC-es PDUs to the correct reordering buffer based on the SRNC configuration. - Reordering: This function reorders received MAC-es PDUs according to the received TSN and Node-B tagging i.e. (CFN, subframe number). MAC-es PDUs with consecutive TSNs are delivered to the disassembly function upon reception. Mechanisms for reordering MAC-es PDUs received out-of-order are left up to the implementation. There is one Re-ordering Process per logical channel. - Macro diversity selection (FDD only): The function is performed in the MAC-es, in case of soft handover with multiple Node-Bs (The soft combining for all the cells of a Node-B takes place in the Node-B). This means that the reordering function receives MAC-es PDUs from each Node-B in the E-DCH active set. The exact implementation is not specified. However the model below is based on one Reordering Queue Distribution entity receiving all the MAC-d flow from all the Node-Bs, and one MAC-es entity per UE. - Disassembly: The disassembly function is responsible for disassembly of MAC-es PDUs. When a MAC-es PDU is disassembled the MAC-es header is removed, the MAC-d PDU’s are extracted and delivered to MAC-d.

When configured by the upper layers the MAC-e and E- DCH scheduler handle HSUPA specific functions in the Node B. In the model below, the MAC-e and E-DCH scheduler comprises the following entities: - E-DCH Scheduling: This function manages E-DCH cell resources between UEs. Based on scheduling requests, Scheduling Grants are determined and transmitted. The general principles of the E-DCH scheduling are described in subclauses 11.8.2.3 and 11.9.2.3 below.

MAC-es PDUs are forwarded to the associated MAC-d flow. - HARQ: One HARQ entity is capable of supporting multiple instances (HARQ processes) of stop and wait HARQ protocols. Each process is responsible for generating ACKs or NACKs indicating delivery status of E-DCH transmissions. The HARQ entity handles all tasks that are required for the HARQ protocol.

The MAC-ehs is responsible for handling the data transmitted on the HS-DSCH when configured. There should be priority handling per MAC-ehs SDU in the MAC- ehs. The MAC-ehs is comprised of six different functional entities: - Flow Control: The flow control for MAC-ehs is identical to the flow control for MAC- hs. - Scheduling/Priority Handling: This function manages HS-DSCH resources between HARQ entities and data flows according to their priority class. In FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD, the scheduler determines for each TTI if single or dual stream transmission should be used. Based on status reports from associated uplink signalling either new transmission or retransmission is determined when operating in CELL_DCH state. In FDD, when operating in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH state HS-DSCH reception, the MAC-ehs can perform retransmission without uplink signalling. In 1.28 Mcps TDD, when operating in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH state and HS-DSCH reception without dedicated H-RNTI, the MAC-ehs can perform retransmission without uplink signalling. Further it sets the logical channel identifiers for each new reordering SDU and TSNs for each new reordering PDU being serviced. To maintain proper transmission priority a new transmission can be initiated on a HARQ process at any time. The TSN is unique to each MAC-ehs Queue ID within a HS-DSCH. It is not permitted to schedule new transmissions, including retransmissions originating in the RLC layer, along with retransmissions originating from the HARQ layer within the same TTI over the same HS-DSCH, and HARQ process (FDD only). It is not permitted to schedule new transmissions, including retransmissions originating in the RLC layer, along with retransmissions originating from the HARQ layer within the same TTI, and HARQ process (TDD only). - HARQ: One HARQ entity handles the hybrid ARQ functionality for one user and per HS-DSCH transport channel (FDD only). One HARQ entity handles the hybrid ARQ functionality for one user (TDD only). One HARQ entity is capable of supporting multiple instances (HARQ process) of stop and wait HARQ protocols.

However implementation is not specified (i.e. depends on RRM strategy). - E-DCH Control: The E-DCH control entity is responsible for reception of scheduling requests and transmission of Scheduling Grants. In FDD, for UEs in CELL_FACH state and Idle mode, the E-DCH control entity is additionally responsible for collision resolution and common E-DCH resource release by transmitting Scheduling Grants. The general principles of the E-DCH schedulling are described in subclauses 11.8.2.3 and 11.9.2.3 below. - De-multiplexing: This function provides de-multiplexing of MAC-i PDUs per E-DCH. For DTCH/DCCH transmission, MAC-is PDUs are forwarded to the associated MAC- d flow. For CCCH transmission (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only), MAC-is PDUs are forwarded to the associated UL Common MAC flow. - Read UE id (FDD only): In CELL_DCH state, no UE ID is included in the MAC-PDU header. In CELL_FACH, the E-RNTI is added in all MAC-i PDUs for DTCH and DCCH transmission at the UE side until\n",
      "Chunk 24: the UE receives an E-AGCH with its E- RNTI (through an E-RNTI-specific CRC attachment). In CELL_FACH state and in Idle mode, CCCH data can be transmitted only as no E-RNTI has been added in the MAC-i PDU for transmission from the UE. - HARQ: One HARQ entity is capable of supporting multiple instances (HARQ processes) of stop and wait HARQ protocols. Each process is responsible for generating ACKs or NACKs indicating delivery status of E-DCH transmissions. The HARQ entity handles all tasks that are required for the HARQ protocol. For FDD, there shall be one HARQ entity per E-DCH. For 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-carrier E-DCH operation, there is one HARQ entity per E-DCH transport channel. The associated signalling shown in the figures illustrates the exchange of information between layer 1 and layer 2 provided by primitives.

The following subclauses provide an overview, the normative description can be found in [2] and [3] respectively. 4.3.1 Transport channels Common transport channel types are: - Random Access Channel(s) (RACH); - Forward Access Channel(s) (FACH); - Downlink Shared Channel(s) (DSCH), for TDD operation only; - High Speed Downlink Shared Channel(s) (HS-DSCH); - Uplink Shared Channel(s) (USCH), for TDD operation only; - Broadcast Channel (BCH); - Paging Channel (PCH); - Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) for UL operation only (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only). Dedicated transport channel types are: - Dedicated Channel (DCH); - Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) for UL operation only. 4.3.2 Logical Channels The MAC layer provides data transfer services on logical channels. A set of logical channel types is defined for different kinds of data transfer services as offered by MAC. Each logical channel type is defined by what type of information is transferred. 4.3.2.1 Logical channel structure The configuration of logical channel types is depicted in figure 4.3.2.1. [pic] Figure 4.3.2.1: Logical channel structure 4.3.2.2 Control Channels Following control channels are used for transfer of control plane information only: - Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH); - Paging Control Channel (PCCH); - Common Control Channel (CCCH); - Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH); - Shared Channel Control Channel (SHCCH); - MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH); - MBMS point-to-multipoint Scheduling Channel (MSCH) 4.3.2.3 Traffic Channels Following traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information only: - Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH); - Common Traffic Channel (CTCH); - MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel (MTCH). 5 Services provided to upper layers This clause describes the different services provided by the MAC to higher layers.

In the drawings in clause 9.1, bit strings are represented by tables in which the first bit is the leftmost one on the first line of the table, the last bit is the rightmost on the last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines. Depending on the provided service, MAC SDUs are bit strings with any non- null length, or bit strings with an integer number of octets in length. An SDU is included into a MAC PDU from first bit onward. In the UE for the uplink, all MAC PDUs delivered to the physical layer within one TTI are defined as Transport Block Set (TBS). It consists of one or several Transport Blocks, each containing one MAC PDU. The Transport Blocks, shall be transmitted in the order as delivered from RLC. When multiplexing of RLC PDUs from different logical channels is performed on MAC, the order of all Transport Blocks originating from the same logical channel shall be the same as the order of the sequence delivered from RLC. The order of the different logical channels in a TBS is set by the MAC protocol. 9.1.2 MAC PDU (not HS-DSCH or E-DCH) A MAC PDU consists of an optional MAC header and a MAC Service Data Unit (MAC SDU), see figure 9.1.2.1. Both the MAC header and the MAC SDU are of variable size. The content and the size of the MAC header depends on the type of the logical channel, and in some cases none of the parameters in the MAC header are needed. The size of the MAC-SDU depends on the size of the RLC-PDU, which is defined during the setup procedure. [pic] Figure 9.1.2.1: MAC PDU 9.1.3 MAC-d PDU (HS-DSCH) For HS-DSCH the MAC-d PDU format equals the MAC PDU format for the non HS-\n",
      "Chunk 30: DSCH case. 9.1.4 MAC PDU (HS-DSCH) There are two different MAC PDU formats for HS-DSCH. Depending on configuration by higher layers the format is either MAC-hs or MAC-ehs. The MAC PDU format is determined by upper layer signalling [7]. When MAC-hs is configured, a MAC PDU for HS-DSCH consists of one MAC-hs header and one or more MAC-hs SDUs where each MAC-hs SDU equals a MAC-d PDU. A maximum of one MAC-hs PDU can be transmitted in a TTI per UE. The MAC-hs header is of variable size. The MAC-hs SDUs in one TTI belongs to the same reordering queue. If the UE receives successive MAC-hs SDUs of the same size in the MAC-hs PDU, represented by multiple (SID, N) combinations, the UE behaviour is not specified. In 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH cell, TSN can be extended to 9bit as indicated by RRC signalling. When TSN is extended to 9bit, the 3 least significant bits are placed after the last MAC-hs SDU. [pic] Figure 9.1.4.1: MAC-hs PDU When MAC-ehs is configured, a MAC PDU for HS-DSCH consists of one MAC-ehs header and one or more reordering PDUs. Each reordering PDU consists of one or more reordering SDUs belonging to the same priority queue. All reordering SDUs belonging to the same priority queue in one TTI shall be mapped to the same reordering PDU. Each reordering SDU equals a complete MAC-ehs SDU or a segment of a MAC-ehs SDU. Each MAC-ehs SDU equals a MAC-d PDU or a MAC-c PDU (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only). The LCH-ID and L fields are repeated per reordering SDU. The TSN and SI fields are repeated per reordering PDU. In 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH cell, TSN can be extended to 9bit as indicated by RRC signalling. When TSN is extended to 9bit, the 3 least significant bits are placed after the last reordering PDU. If several TSNs is included in MAC-ehs header, the extented bits of TSN should be concatenated in the same order as that of the TSN occurrrence in the MAC-ehs header. For FDD, the size of the TSN field is configurable by upper layers [7]. The presence of the TSNi and SIi fields is based on the value of the LCH- IDi; if the LCH-IDi is mapped to the same reordering queue as LCH-IDi-1 or if the value of LCH-IDi-1 is equal to the value of LCH-IDi, there is no TSNi or SIi field. The mapping of the LCH-ID to the reordering queue is provided by upper layers [7], except for BCCH or PCCH where no reordering is applied. The TSN1 and SI1 fields are always present. For BCCH or PCCH the TSN field, if present, is always set to zero, the SI field, if present, is always set to '00' and the TSN and SI fields shall be ignored by the receiver. Depending on the HS-DSCH physical layer category, the maximum number of MAC- ehs PDUs that can be transmitted in a TTI per UE is one or two per HS-DSCH transport channel. The reordering SDUs in one TTI can\n",
      "Chunk 31: belong to different priority queues. The reordering SDUs in one TTI can belong to at most 3 priority queues. The MAC- ehs header is of variable size. The UE behaviour is unspecified, if any of the following conditions are met: - if reordering SDUs in one TTI belong to more than 3 priority queues, - if the TSN field extension for MAC-ehs entity is not configured and MAC-ehs PDU(s) received during one TTI contain more than 26 reordering SDUs, or, - if the TSN field extension for MAC-ehs entity is configured and MAC- ehs PDU(s) received during one TTI contain more than 44 reordering SDUs. [pic] Figure 9.1.4.2: MAC-ehs PDU [pic] Figure 9.1.4.3: MAC-hs PDU (1.28Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH operation mode only) [pic] Figure 9.1.4.4: MAC-ehs PDU (1.28Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH operation mode only) 9.1.5 MAC PDU (E-DCH) There are two different MAC PDU formats for E-DCH. Depending on configuration by upper layers the format is either MAC-e/es or MAC-i/is. The MAC PDU format is determined by upper layer signalling [7]. When MAC-e/es is configured, there are two MAC sublayers, MAC-e and MAC-es. MAC-es sits on top of MAC-e and receives PDUs directly from MAC-d. MAC-es SDUs (i.e. MAC-d PDUs) of the same size, coming from a particular logical channel are multiplexed together into a single MAC-es payload. There is one and only one MAC-es PDU per logical channel per TTI (since only one MAC-d PDU size is allowed per logical channel per TTI). To this payload is prepended the MAC-es header (see subclause 9.2.4.1). The number of PDUs, as well as the one DDI value identifying the logical channel, the MAC-d flow and the MAC-es SDU size are included as part of the MAC-e header. In case sufficient space is left in the E-DCH transport block or if Scheduling Information needs to be transmitted, an SI will be included at the end of the MAC-e PDU (see subclause 9.2.4.2). Multiple MAC-es PDUs from multiple logical channels, but only one MAC-e PDU can be transmitted in a TTI. In the example MAC-e PDU shown in figure 9.1.5.2a, the field DDI0 is referring to the specific DDI value that indicates that there is an SI included in the MAC-e PDU (see subclause 9.2.4.2). This header will not be associated with a new MAC-es payload. Figure 9.1.5.2b shows the MAC-e PDU format when SI is sent alone. In this case DDI0 is not included in the MAC- e PDU and E-TFCI value 0 is used. [pic] Figure 9.1.5.1 MAC-es PDU [pic] Figure 9.1.5.2a: MAC-e PDU [pic] Figure 9.1.5.2b: MAC-e PDU (SI is sent alone) When MAC-i/is is configured, there are two MAC sublayers, MAC-i and MAC-is. MAC-is sits on top of MAC-i and receives PDUs directly from MAC-d and MAC-c (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only). When MAC-i/is is configured, a MAC PDU for E- DCH consists of one MAC-i header and one or more MAC-is PDUs. Each MAC-is PDU consists of one or more MAC-is SDUs belonging to the same logical channel. Each MAC-is SDU equals a complete or a segment of a\n",
      "Chunk 32: MAC-d PDU or a MAC-c PDU (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD only). The MAC-is SDUs can have different sizes. The LCH-ID and L fields are repeated per MAC-is SDU (see subclause 9.2.4.4). The TSN and SS fields are repeated per MAC-is PDU (see subclause 9.2.4.3). Multiple MAC-is PDUs from multiple logical channels, but only one MAC-i PDU can be transmitted in a TTI per E-DCH. In case sufficient space is left in the E-DCH transport block or if Scheduling Information needs to be transmitted, an SI will be included at the end of the MAC-i PDU (see Figure 9.1.5.4a and subclause 11.8.1.6 and subclause 11.9.1.5). For 1.28Mcps TDD multi-carrier E-DCH operation with more than one carrier group(defined in subclause 9.2.6.3) configured by high layer ,the sufficient space is more than 33 bits in the E-DCH transport block or if Scheduling Information needs to be transmitted, an extend SI (see Figure 9.2.6.3.-1a) will be included at the end of the MAC-i PDU(see Figure 9.1.5.4a and subclause 11.9.1.5), and if the sufficient space is more than 23 bits and less than 33 bits or only one carrier group is configured by high layer, the legacy SI(see Figure 9.2.6.3.-1) will be included at the end of MAC-i PDU(see Figure 9.1.5.4a and subclause 11.9.1.5). For FDD and in CELL_FACH state only, the UE’s E-RNTI can be included in the MAC-i header. Its inclusion is signalled with a reserved LCH-ID value. [pic] Figure 9.1.5.3 MAC-is PDU.

The size and coding of TCTF for FDD and TDD are shown in tables 9.2.1.1, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.3, 9.2.1.4 and 9.2.1.5. Note that the size of the TCTF field of FACH for FDD is 2,4 or 8 bits and for TDD is either 3 or 5 bits depending on the value of the 3 most significant bits. The TCTF of the RACH for TDD is either 2 or 4 bits depending on the value of the 2 most significant bits.

The VF field shall be set to zero and the value one is reserved in this version of the protocol. - Queue identifier (Queue ID): The Queue ID field provides identification of the reordering queue in the receiver, in order to support independent buffer handling of data belonging to different reordering queues. The length of the Queue ID field is 3 bit. - Transmission Sequence Number (TSN): The TSN field provides an identifier for the transmission sequence number on the HS-DSCH. The TSN field is used for reordering purposes to support in-sequence delivery to higher layers. For 1.28 Mcps TDD multi- frequency HS-DSCH operation mode, the length of the TSN field can be 6 bits or 9 bits, which is configured by higher layer. For other operation modes, the length of the TSN field is 6 bit. - Size index identifier (SID): The SID fields identifies the size of a set of consecutive MAC-d PDUs. The MAC-d PDU size for a given SID is configured by higher layers and is independent for each Queue ID. The length of the SID field is 3 bit. - Number of MAC-D PDUs (N): The number of consecutive MAC-d PDUs with equal size is identified with the N field. The length of the N field is 7 bits.

If more PDUs than the defined maximum number of PDUs for the corresponding mode are received, the UE behaviour is unspecified. - Flag (F): The F field is a flag indicating if more fields are present in the MAC- hs header or not. If the F field is set to \"0\" the F field is followed by an additional set of SID, N and F fields. If the F field is set to \"1\" the F field is followed by a MAC-d PDU. The maximum number of MAC- hs header extensions, i.e. number of fields F set to \"0\", in a single TTI shall be assumed to be 7. If more extensions than the maximum defined for the corresponding mode are included in a TTI, the UE behaviour is unspecified. If MAC-ehs is configured by upper layers [7], the parameters for the MAC header are: - Logical channel identifier (LCH-ID): The LCH-ID field provides identification of the logical channel at the receiver and the re-ordering buffer destination of a reordering SDU. The length of the LCH-ID is 4 bits. In FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD, when SDU from BCCH or PCCH logical channel is transmitted on HS-DSCH the LCH-ID field in MAC-ehs header is set to 1111. The identification of the logical channel is done based on H-RNTI value used for broadcast information in or for paging in HS-SCCH. Table 9.2.2-0 shows the 4-bit LCH-ID field.

The TSN field is used for reordering purposes to support in-sequence delivery to higher layers. For FDD, the length of the TSN field is either 6 or 14 bits, depending on configuration of TSN field extension for MAC-ehs entity by upper layers [7]. - Segmentation Indication (SI) The SI field indicates if the MAC-ehs SDU has been segmented.

The reordering SDU size can vary for each reordering SDU in the MAC-ehs PDU, and is set for each reordering SDU individually. The length of the Length field is 11 bits. - Flag (F) The F field is a flag indicating if more fields are present in the MAC- ehs header or not. If the F field is set to \"0\" the F field is followed by an additional set of LCH-ID and L fields and optionally (as described in section 9.1.4) TSN and SI fields. If the F field is set to \"1\" the F field is followed by a reordering PDU.

Padding is not explicitly indicated but is included in the end of the MAC-hs PDU if the total size of the MAC-hs payload plus the MAC-hs header is smaller than the transport block set size. If MAC-ehs is configured by upper layers [7]: a) DTCH or DCCH mapped to HS-DSCH: - There is always one LCH ID field and L field for each reordering SDU included in the MAC-ehs PDU and one TSN and SI field for each reordering PDU included in the MAC-ehs PDU.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-frequency HS-DSCH operation, the mapping of transport block size to TFRI value is dependent upon the HS-DSCH physical layer category or HS-DSCH physical layer category extension configured by high layer [7]. When MAC-hs is used, if neither HS-DSCH SPS operation nor E-DCH SPS operation is enabled, the bit aligned table of transport block size defined as following shall be used. If k is the signalled TFRI value then the corresponding HS-DSCH transport block size Lk is given by: If k = 1..62 [pic] where [pic] if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 1 and 3 inclusively, [pic] if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 4 and 6 inclusively, [pic] if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 7 and 9 inclusively, [pic] if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 10 and 12 inclusively, [pic] if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 13 and 15 inclusively, and [pic] If k = 63 then, Lk = 2788 if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 1 and 3 inclusively, 5600 if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 4 and 6 inclusively, 8416 if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 7 and 9 inclusively, 11226 if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 10 and 12 inclusively, 14043 if the HS-DSCH physical layer category is between 13 and 15 inclusively. If k=0, Lk indicates NULL and shall not be used to signal a transport block size in the TFRI.

This information is used for reordering purposes to support in- sequence delivery to higher layers. The length of the TSN field is 6 bits. 9.2.4.2 MAC-e header parameters - Data description indicator (DDI): The DDI field identifies the logical channel, MAC-d flow and size of the MAC-d PDUs concatenated into the associated MAC-es PDU. The mapping between the DDI values and the logical channel ID, MAC-d flow and PDU size is provided by higher layers. The length of the DDI field is 6 bits. - For FDD: When, due to the quantization in the transport block sizes that can be supported or triggering of the Scheduling Information, the size of the data plus header is less than or equal to the TB size of the E-TFC selected by the UE minus 24 bits, the DDI value [111111] shall be appended at the end of the MAC-e header and a Scheduling Information shall be concatenated into this MAC-e PDU, where DDI value [111111] indicates that there is a Scheduling Information concatenated in this MAC-e PDU. Otherwise, if the size of the data plus header is less than or equal to the TB size of the E-TFC selected by the UE minus 18 bits, a Scheduling Information shall be concatenated into this MAC-e PDU. In any other case it is understood that another MAC-es PDU or Scheduling Information does not fit and it is therefore not necessary to reserve room in the transport block for an additional DDI field. - For TDD: When, due to the quantization in the transport block sizes that can be supported or triggering of the Scheduling Information (due to timer expiry, see subclauses 11.9.1.4a and 11.9.1.5), the size of the data plus header\n",

In any other case it is understood that another MAC-es PDU or Scheduling Information does not fit and it is therefore not necessary to reserve room in the transport block for an additional DDI field. - Number of MAC-d PDUs (N): The number of consecutive MAC-d PDUs corresponding to the same DDI value. The length of the N field is 6 bits. 9.2.4.3 MAC-is header parameters - Transmission Sequence Number (TSN): The TSN field provides the transmission sequence number for the MAC-is PDU. This information is used for reordering purposes to support in- sequence delivery to higher layers. For TDD, the length of the TSN field is 6 bits. For FDD and 1.28Mcps TDD, the length of the TSN field is either 6 or 14 bits, depending on configuration of TSN field extension for MAC-i/is entity by upper layers [7]. - Segmentation Status (SS): The Segmentation Status (SS) field provides indication of the segmentation status of the MAC SDU or segment of MAC SDU belonging to the logical channel identified by the LCH-ID field. The length of the SS field is 2 bits.

The size can vary for each SDU in the MAC-is PDU, and is set for each SDU individually. The length of the Length field is 11 bits. - Logical channel identifier (LCH-ID): The LCH-ID field provides identification of the logical channel at the receiver and the re-ordering buffer destination of a MAC-is SDU. In FDD, one LCH-ID value is reserved to indicate that the UE’s E-RNTI is included in the MAC-i header. The length of the LCH-ID is 4 bits.

If the F field is set to \"0\" the F field is followed by an additional set of LCH-ID, L and F fields. If the F field is set to \"1\" the F field is followed by a MAC-is PDU. Each header extension corresponds to one MAC-is SDU. - E-RNTI (FDD only) The E-RNTI field provides the UE’s E-RNTI value. - Spare (S) (FDD only): The S field is needed to achieve octet alignment in case the UE’s E- RNTI is included in the MAC-i header. In this version of the specification, the spare field shall be set to \"0000\". 9.2.5 Signaling of control information for FDD E-DCH 9.2.5.1 HARQ information This control information is used in support of the uplink hybrid ARQ functionality. - ACK/NACK information: Transmitted on the E-HICH, on the downlink frequency associated with the uplink frequency where the uplink transmission was made, from each cell in the E-DCH active set of each Activated Uplink Frequency, the ACK/NACK information indicates the successful or un-successful decoding of the corresponding uplink transmission. This information allows the UE to know whether to make another transmission for the same MAC-e or MAC-i PDU or to start the transmission of a new one. The length of the ACK/NACK field is 1 bit. - RSN: Transmitted on the E-DPCCH, the RSN is used to convey the uplink HARQ transmission number. Because of the limitation in the field size, the RSN saturates to the maximum value once that is reached. The combination of the RSN and the transmission timing allows the receiver to determine the exact transmission number\n",
      "Chunk 54: (see [16]). The length of the RSN field is 2 bits. 9.2.5.2 DL Scheduling information This control information is used by Node-Bs in a UE's E-DCH active set in order to control its use of E-DCH system resources. 9.2.5.2.1 Relative Grants - Serving Relative Grant: The Serving Relative Grant is defined per Configured Uplink Frequency. The Serving Relative Grant is transmitted on the downlink frequency associated with the uplink frequency where the uplink transmission will be made. The Serving Relative Grant is transmitted on the E-RGCH from all cells in the serving E-DCH RLS, and from all cells in the Secondary Serving E-DCH RLS, when the Secondary Uplink Frequency is activated. The serving relative grant allows the Node B scheduler to incrementally adjust the serving grant of UEs under its control. By definition, there can only be one serving relative grant command received at any one time per Activated Uplink Frequency. This indication can take three different values, \"UP\", \"DOWN\" or \"HOLD\". - Non-serving Relative Grant: The Non-serving Relative Grant is defined per Configured Uplink Frequency. The Non-Serving Relative Grant is transmitted on the downlink frequency associated with the uplink frequency where the uplink transmission will be made. The Non-Serving Relative Grant is transmitted on the E-RGCH from a non-serving E-DCH RL and from Secondary Non-Serving E-DCH RL. The non-serving relative grant allows neighboring Node Bs to adjust the transmitted rate of UEs that are not under their control in order to avoid overload situations. By definition, there could be multiple non-serving relative grant commands received by MAC at any time per Activated Uplink Frequency. This indication can take two different values, \"DOWN\" or \"HOLD\". The handling of the Relative Grant signalling is based on the Scheduling Grant table configured by higher layers and shown in Tables 9.2.5.2.1.1and 9.2.5.2.1.2.

The absolute grant message is sent on the downlink frequency associated with the uplink frequency where the uplink transmission will be made, on the configured E-AGCH, from the Serving E-DCH cell and from the Secondary Serving E-DCH cell when the Secondary Uplink Frequency is activated. The absolute grant message allows the Node B scheduler to directly adjust the granted rate of UEs under its control. In FDD, the channel is also used for collision resolution and release of common E-DCH resources. The E-AGCH is a shared channel that uses an E-RNTI specific CRC in order to address messages to specific users (see [16]). The RRC may configure the MAC-e or MAC-i with two different E-RNTIs per Configured Uplink Frequency, one primary and one secondary. Based on the identity that is used, the following information will be conveyed implicitly when an absolute grant message is received: - Identity Type: This variable will take the value \"Primary\" or \"Secondary\" respectively based on whether the message was addressed to the primary or the secondary E-RNTI. The absolute grant message itself includes multiple fields that are\n",
      "Chunk 56: multiplexed together into 6 bits inside the MAC-e or MAC-i of the Node B and then submitted to the physical layer for transmission on the E-AGCH. These fields are: - Absolute Grant Value: This field is used to determine the maximum E-DCH traffic to pilot ratio (E-DPDCH/DPCCH) that the UE is allowed to use in the next transmission. The length of the Absolute Grant Value field is 5 bits. - Absolute Grant Scope: This field indicates the applicability of the Absolute Grant. It can take two different values, \"Per HARQ process\" or \"All HARQ processes\", allowing to indicate whether the HARQ process activation/de-activation will affect one or all processes. The Absolute Grant Scope is encoded in 1 bit. In CELL_DCH state, when the E-DCH is configured with 10ms TTI, only the value \"All HARQ processes\" is valid (see subclause 10). In case Identity Type is \"Secondary\", only the value \"All HARQ processes\" is valid in this version of the protocol. In CELL_FACH state, only the value \"All HARQ processes\" is valid (see subclause 10). - Common E-DCH resource release (FDD only in CELL_FACH): An AG with value set to 'INACTIVE' is used by the Node B to release common E-DCH resources. 9.2.5.3 UL Scheduling information This control information is used by UEs to indicate to their serving E-DCH Node-B the amount of resources they require. 9.2.5.3.1 Happy Bit The happy bit is a single bit field that is passed from MAC to the physical layer for inclusion on the E-DPCCH. This field takes two values, \"Not Happy\" and \"Happy\" indicating respectively whether the UE could use more resources or not. The setting of the Happy Bit is defined in subclause 11.8.1.5. A happy bit is reported on each of the Activated Uplink Frequencies. 9.2.5.3.2 Scheduling Information The Scheduling Information is located at the end of the MAC-e or MAC-i PDU and is used to provide the serving Node B with a better view of the amount of system resources needed by the UE and the amount of resources it can actually make use of. The transmission of this information will be initiated due to the quantization of the transport block sizes that can be supported or based on the triggers defined in subclause 11.8.1.6. When a Scheduling Information is transmitted, its contents shall always be updated in new transmissions with the buffer status after application of the E-TFC selection procedure described in subclause 11.8.1.4. The logical channels for which a non-scheduled grant is configured shall never be taken into account when putting together this information. In addition, the RRC may restrict applicability for logical channels for which no non-scheduled grant was configured. A Scheduling Information is reported independently on each of the Activated Uplink Frequencies. This information includes the following fields: - Highest priority Logical channel ID (HLID): The HLID field identifies unambiguously the highest priority logical channel with available data. If multiple logical channels exist with the highest priority, the one corresponding to the highest buffer occupancy will be reported. The length of the HLID is 4 bits. In case the\n",

If MAC-i/is is configured, it also includes the amount of data that is available for transmission in the MAC-i/is segmentation entity. When MAC is connected to an AM RLC entity, control PDUs to be transmitted and RLC PDUs outside the RLC Tx window shall also be included in the TEBS. RLC PDUs that have been transmitted but not negatively acknowledged by the peer entity shall not be included in the TEBS. The length of this field is 5 bits.

If NACK is received then the UE may retransmit if appropriate physical resources are available, otherwise it must receive a further Grant before it can retransmit the MAC-e or MAC-i PDU. The length of the ACK/NACK field is 1 bit. - RSN: Transmitted on the E-UCCH, the RSN is used to convey the uplink HARQ transmission number. Because of the limitation in the field size, the maximum value that the RSN can represent is equal to 3. Once the RSN reaches this value, the RSN shall alternate between the values of 2 and 3 for any subsequent consecutive retransmissions. Thus, the RSN sequence follows the pattern 0,1,2,3,2,3,2,3,…(see subclause 11.9.1.1.2). The length of the RSN field is 2 bits. - HARQ Process Identifier Transmitted on the E-UCCH, the HARQ process identifier is selected by the UE and identifies the HARQ process for which the MAC-e or MAC-i PDU is being transmitted/retransmitted. The length of the HARQ process identifier field is 3 bits. For TDD, the MSB of the HARQ Process Identifier is not transmitted by the physical layer but may be inferred by the Node-B according to the nature of the physical resources used (scheduled or unscheduled). HARQ processes associated with scheduled transmission utilise HARQ Process Identifiers 0 to 3. 9.2.6.2 DL Scheduling information This control information is used by a Node-B in order to control its use of E-DCH system resources. 9.2.6.2.1 Absolute Grant The Absolute Grant is defined per configured E-DCH carrier for 1.28Mcps TDD. The Absolute Grant is sent on downlink on a set of configured E-AGCHs from the serving E-DCH cell, and when the multiple carriers E-DCH resources are configured for 1.28Mcps TDD, the Absolute Grant of one carrier is sent on the E-AGCH of this carrier where the associated E-DCH is transmitted, the Absoulte Grant allows the Node B scheduler to directly adjust the granted rate and assigned physical resources for UEs under its control. The physical resource assignment indicates to the UE the maximum amount of uplink resources that it may use for a scheduled transmission. The E-AGCH is a shared channel that uses an E-RNTI specific CRC in order to address messages to specific UEs (see [19]). For TDD, the RRC shall configure the MAC with a primary E-RNTI only. A UE is required to monitor a set of E-AGCHs. The RRC signals to the UE details of the set of E-AGCHs that are to be monitored. The UE decodes an Absolute Grant intended for it on the basis of the E-RNTI sent to it by the Node B via the SRNC and by RRC. The following information will be conveyed in an absolute grant message: -\n",

These fields are: - Absolute Grant Value: For TDD, this field indicates the maximum E-PUCH transmission power to reference power ratio per TDD resource unit that the UE is allowed to use on the E-DCH resources associated with the Absolute Grant. A TDD resource unit is defined as one sixteenth of the OVSF codespace in one timeslot. The length of the Absolute Grant Value field for TDD is 5 bits. - Channelisation Code: This field describes the code component of the physical resource grant. For 1.28/3.84 Mcps TDD it comprises an enumerated value of length 5 bits indicating which node on the OVSF code tree has been allocated. For 7.68 Mcps TDD it comprises an enumerated value of length 6 bits indicating which node on the OVSF tree has been allocated. The mapping between the allocated OVSF and the enumerated node 0…30 for 1.28/3.84 Mcps and 0…62 for 7.68 Mcps is as given in [19]. - Timeslot Resource Related Information: This field describes the timeslot component of the physical resource grant and comprises a bitmap of length nTRRI. For 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD, the TRRI field indicates which of the timeslots configured for E-DCH use by RRC have been allocated with the LSB corresponding to the lowest numbered E-DCH timeslot and the MSB corresponding to the highest numbered timeslot. The length of the TRRI field (nTRRI) is 5 bits and is configurable by RRC on a per-cell basis between 1 and 12 bits for 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the length of the TRRI field (nTRRI) is 5 bits with MSB corresponding to TS1 and LSB corresponding to TS5. - Resource Duration Indicator: Optionally, RRC may configure, on a per-cell basis the presence of a resource duration indicator field on E-AGCH for TDD. If configured as present in a cell, 3 bits are used to indicate the number of TTI’s allocated and the spacing between the allocated TTIs via a single grant according to table 9.2.6.2.1-2. If the field is configured as not present on E-AGCH in the cell, a value of 0 is implicitly assumed by the UE corresponding to 1 TTI.

If MAC- i/is is configured, it also includes the amount of data that is available for transmission in the MAC-i/is segmentation entity. When MAC is connected to an AM RLC entity, control PDUs to be transmitted and RLC PDUs outside the RLC Tx window shall also be included in the TEBS. RLC PDUs that have been transmitted but not negatively acknowledged by the peer entity shall not be included in the TEBS. - Highest priority Logical channel Buffer Status (HLBS) The HLBS field indicates the amount of data available from the logical channel identified by HLID, relative to the highest value of the buffer size range reported by TEBS when the reported TEBS index is not 31, and relative to 50000 bytes when the reported TEBS index is 31. - UE Power Headroom (UPH): The UPH field of a carrier on which the scheduling information will be transmitted indicates the ratio of the maximum UE transmission power and the calculated UE transmit power of that frequency defined as in [18] that would result for βe equal to 0.
